Item #1: Jira board status (chang will sync).
chang, pls help share the task status
</p>

<p>
lafenicecc 11:01 AM
coverage test is done, good job @camelbeck
what about e2e test? 😁 @ray
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:03 AM
aha, we have that item later. u wanna sync now or later? @ray
</p>

<p>
ray 11:04 AM
@WeiHu and me have built a basic framework of the e2e test of our sdk-py (with the help of node sdk and java sdk) and we are working together on my personal github repo, we plan to re-structure the patch-set after a certain period and submit a CR to upstream
👍 2  
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:05 AM
great! ray and wei
while i would suggest we first submit some basic code framework for review.
This is also for the item #2: <a href="https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/q/project:fabric-sdk-py" class="urlextern" title="https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/q/project:fabric-sdk-py"  rel="nofollow">https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/q/project:fabric-sdk-py</a>
We encourage each patchset keep smaller and focused.
</p>

</p>

<p>
baohua 11:06 AM
let&#039;s move quickly with smaller steps, rather than throw out bunch of code one time~~
close collaboration will be more efficient, how do u think?
</p>

<p>
ray 11:07 AM
Yes, I mean submit several refined CRs to upstream, not a bunch of code 😉
</p>

<p>
lafenicecc 11:07 AM
😍
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:08 AM
thanks! ray, look forward to seeing ur patchsets soon!
OK, everyone pls help review each new patchset, and after submitting a patchset, remember to share within the channel after ci passed to call for reviewers. Thanks!
OK. item#3. MVP remaining tasks discussion (kai will sync, 1768 to @lafenicecc and 1769 to @grapebaba).
@grapebaba could u help sync the mvp work?
@lafenicecc for comments, too
</p>

<p>
grapebaba 11:09 AM
i am still doing 1769
</p>

<p>
ray 11:10 AM
Let&#039;s move quickly 🙂
</p>

<p>
grapebaba 11:10 AM
since there are some differences between java and node sdk
</p>

<p>
ray 11:11 AM
seem the network delay of my side is terrible 😞
</p>

<p>
grapebaba 11:11 AM
I try to find a better way
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:11 AM
thanks kai.
how about the 1768 @lafenicecc
</p>

<p>
lafenicecc 11:11 AM
i will collaborate more with 🍇baba
</p>

<p>
grapebaba 11:12 AM
right now i feel the implementation of java SDK is more better than node
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:12 AM
sure, and each unfinished task can submit a WIP patchset for letting others know the work is beginning.
👍 1  
aha, i know u&#039;re also a java expert!
</p>

<p>
camelbeck 11:12 AM
👍
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:12 AM
that&#039;s great we have so many experts on various domains!
OK. item #4: Test coverage functionality status (Chao Li will sync)
@camelbeck pls go on~~
:woo:
</p>

<p>
camelbeck 11:13 AM
OK, as @lafenicecc just mentioned, I finished coverage test this week, and satus on jira is marked DONE now.
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:14 AM
Thanks, chao, and have u go through the existing documentation and code structure already? ☯
</p>

<p>
camelbeck 11:15 AM
I have read the documents, but still have not read code now
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:15 AM
u must have setup the local env, right?
</p>

<p>
camelbeck 11:15 AM
yes
with your docker images 😀
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:15 AM
the fabric code has recently changed a little. I hope u can help update our ci docker images to latest 0.8.8.
</p>

<p>
camelbeck 11:16 AM
Sure, no problem
👍 1  
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:16 AM
@lafenicecc pls help create a jira task for chao. 😬
thanks chao!
</p>

<p>
lafenicecc 11:16 AM
np
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:16 AM
OK. item #5: E2E test (Ray Chen will sync) has synced already.
Do we have other issues to discuss today?
</p>

<p>
ray 11:17 AM
@camelbeck question about the coverage test tool you choose: I saw you choose a tool called py-cover ? instead of coverage, what&#039;s your consideration, can you share a little bit about this?
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:17 AM
good question.
😏
</p>

<p>
camelbeck 11:17 AM
<a href="https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2938" class="urlextern" title="https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2938"  rel="nofollow">https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2938</a>
I have recorded the reason for this choice.
Have you read about that? Or still have questions? @ray
</p>

<p>
lafenicecc 11:18 AM
very detailed description, cool!
</p>

<p>
camelbeck 11:19 AM
Simply speaking, pytest-cov can be integrated with pytest.
</p>

<p>
ray 11:19 AM
So we used a hybrid solution, do we?
</p>

<p>
camelbeck 11:20 AM
Coverage in my solution is only used to get the coverage test result.
But, pytest-cov depends on coverage package.
</p>

<p>
ray 11:21 AM
Okay I see. Thanks for your detailed explanation @camelbeck 🙂
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:21 AM
@camelbeck Have u solved the ci stuck problem finally?
test/unit/keyvaluestore_test.py why would stuck there?
</p>

<p>
camelbeck 11:22 AM
Not yet, actually in my own environment, most of the time I run make unittest, the process will be stuck there.
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:22 AM
Let&#039;s record the stuck problem, and maybe can raise a separate bug in jira tasks.
Ok, last time remember @grapebaba has proposed the rxpy discussion, Have u created the issue? any further progress on that?
🚋
</p>

<p>
grapebaba 11:24 AM
not yet
</p>

<p>
camelbeck 11:24 AM
OK @baohua
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:24 AM
🛴
@grapebaba @camelbeck pls use our jira board often, to record the problems and discussions 🙂
</p>

<p>
camelbeck 11:25 AM
👌
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:25 AM
Thanks and also to everyone
</p>

<p>
grapebaba 11:25 AM

</p>

<p>
baohua 11:25 AM
Ok, any more issue to discuss today?
</p>

<p>
camelbeck 11:25 AM
I think we could make some improvements to our Makefile.
Just suggestions
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:26 AM
Sure @camelbeck feel free to create jira task and share here for discussion first.
any suggestion would be encouraged in open-source world
</p>

<p>
camelbeck 11:26 AM
OK
</p>

<p>
baohua 11:26 AM
