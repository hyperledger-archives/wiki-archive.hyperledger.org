====== Client Onboarding of a Buy-Side Fund by a Broker/Dealer ======

===== Section 1 - Intro =====

==== Business Problem / Opportunity ====

When a mutual fund or pension fund wants to buy or sell stocks, bonds or options, they will typically conduct the transactions through a broker/dealer. Before the fund can start trading through the broker/dealer, they need to establish a formal, legally-recognized business relationship.

The process for establishing this relationship is known as, "Client Onboarding." It is a complex, heavily regulated, costly, risky and manually intensive process. Participants, the industry and the general public could benefit from faster, more automated and more certain boostrapping of these formal trading relationships.

==== Current Solution ====

The current approach to client onboarding of funds by broker/dealers typically involves a combination of processes, data and documents spread out across multiple departments, systems and firms. For example:

  *  Sales & Trading
  *  New Business
  *  Know-Your-Customer (KYC) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)'s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons
  *  Account Opening
  *  Risk
  *  Legal
  *  Operations
  *  Collateral Management

==== Why a Blockchain? ====

Blockchains could be applied in several different areas to improve client onboarding. For example:

  *  Legal Entity Identifier - Provide an internal and external mechanism to record and lookup unique identifiers for parties to the transactions
  *  AML/KYC/OFAC - Transition OFAC list from a list of textual aliases to governement-issued PKI identifiers for certainty of either whitelist or blacklist lookup and provide non-reputiatable mechanism that check was made and when and by whom
  *  New Business Committee - Provide non-repudiatable, immuttable record for audit and regulatory purposes of who signed off based upon what documentation for establishing the relationships
  *  Legal - Provide a formal, networked mechanism for e-signatures among counterparties, for signing authority attestation and for document transmission and formal legal notices
  *  Ready-to-trade - Provide clear, formal, auditable internal and external mechanism to signal formal readiness for trading to begin
