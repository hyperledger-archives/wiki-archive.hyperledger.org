====== Corporate Action ======

===== Section 1 - Intro =====

==== Overview of the Business Problem or Opportunity ====

Company A announces its intention to raise 2 Billion USD by way of rights issue. Because this is a voluntary action, Company A needs to ensure that complete details of the offer are sent to shareholders in real time, regardless of how many intermediaries are involved in the process (such as receiving/paying agents, CSD, ICSD, local/global custodian banks, asset management firms, etc). Once a shareholder has made a decision, that decision will also be processed and settled (including the new issuance of shares) in real time. If a shareholder sold its rights to a third party, the securities depository must be able to record the new shares under the name of their new rightful owner.
