====== Equity Contracts Use Case ======

**Equity** (finance), the value of an ownership interest in property, including shareholders' equity in a business. Equity or shareholdersÂ´ equity is part of the total capital of a business. Hyperledger technology can be used to implement some of the use cases.

===== Transfer the ownership =====
The process of changing ownership is more complex than simply giving someone a piece of paper. Transfer of ownership is the means by which the ownership of a property is transferred from one hand to another. This includes the purchase of a property, assumption of mortgage debt, exchange of possession of a property or any other land trust device.

Each transaction of ownership transfer should be confirmed by authority. Such "Transaction confirmation" role can be delegated to community with the help of Hyperledger.

== Sample application ==

An example of Hyperledger-based application, which emulates share exchange mechanism, is published [[https://github.com/stanliberman/obc-peer/tree/master/openchain/example/chaincode/asset_manager | here]] 

Application emulates transfer of 'shares'  between registered users' accounts. There are following users' roles: 

  * **Issuer** - Only user with role 'Issuer' can issue new shares on the market by placing them in their account.
  * **Transactor** - Can transfer shares from their account.
  * **Auditor** - Read-only role. Has an access to information bout transactions and current state for all accounts.
  * **Administrator** - Can create new user accounts. Can grant or revoke permissions. 

Matrix of responsibilities:

^ Role ^ Issue new stocks ^ Read balance (( In this example all registered users have an access to information about other users' account state. )) ^ Transfer stocks between accounts ^ Manage Users
