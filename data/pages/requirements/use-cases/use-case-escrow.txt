====== Escrow Payment Verification Use Case ======

A trusted third party takes responsibility for verifying the availability of funds in advance of the closing of the sale of a good (e.g., real estate purchase).

All of the steps to close including verifying payment, title search, etc., could be on the blockchain:

  - Sale agreement/contract
  - Clearing of contingencies to sale
  - Certificate of ownership/title search
  - Good Faith Estimate for closing costs
  - Proof of transfer of funds from buyer and mortgage lender to an escrow account
  - Final closing costs (HUD-1 in the US)
  - Financial clearing of seller's financial obligations (if appropriate)
  - Proof of purchase and transfer of title
