Related to "Fiduciary Code" are "Fiduciary Events". Runtime events like a smart contract that evals to false needs to be recorded in the blockchain for non-repudiation purposes. Likewise, voting a validator node in or out has business / regulatory implications, so should also be recorded on the block.

@jeremysevareid: waht does "a smart contract that evals to false" mean?  Just want to get clarity ....

jeremysevareid [1:02 PM] 
i.e., transaction that is validated / confirmed or not (e.g., signatures are valid or if they are not)

chetsky [1:07 PM] 
aha.  ok, so you mean a submitted tran, that wasn't validated.  gotit.  indeed, we agree.
