====== Use Case Art and Antique Trading ======
**Art Auctions** - Art Auctions are a multi-million dollar business and conducted by a number of auction houses world-wide. Important aspects of art auctions include the authenticity of the Artwork, the ownership, previous hammer bids and winning bids, artist, authenticated certificate(s), owner, buyer etc. Typically, an owner approaches an auction house with a "reserve" price. The auction house validates the art and establishes the bidding process. Once the bidding process is complete, the auction house collects payments and commissions and facilitates the shipment of the work to the new owner.

Blockchain can help in managing art inventory, auction details and transactions and ensure authenticity by effectively blocking fakes from entering the market. Blockchain can help build a single ledger of art inventory and auction related transaction history, and enable multiple auction house to function in a blockchain network.

===== Section 1 - Introduction =====

This is a Draft and will be updated.


==== Overview of the Business Problem or Opportunity ====

Art auction industry is becoming more and more decentralized, while Sotheby &amp; Christi are still at the forefront, rise of numerous smaller players often make it difficult to establish authenticity of art.

Maintaining a trail of transactions where art changes hands is difficult. Also, as more and more affordable art is going through auction route, it is difficult for current systems to service this market in a cost effective and all inclusive way.

==== Current Solution ====

Currently online auction companies operate over the internet and act as the middlemen operating on behalf of the art owners and receiving bids online from buyers. Authenticity of the art is verified by these auction houses offline and certificate of provenance are provided as part of the sale. Some of such auction houses are [[http://paddle8.com/ | Paddle8]],  [[http://artnet.com/ | Artnet]], and  [[http://auctionata.com/ | Auctionata]].

==== Why Distributed Ledger technology? ====

Block Chain can provide over-encompassing platform for Buyers and Sellers or Traders, Banks, Insurance Companies, Shipping and Forwarding, Auction Houses, Art Dealers, Artists to perform simultaneously. The chains associated with these transactions also provide an immutable record of the change of ownership across auction houses and transactions, and serves as a single source of truth.

On the network each of the players can exist as nodes, while the art itself can be modeled as colored coins, which are transacted amongst the nodes. Smart contracts can be created to take care of the auctioneering process. While monetary transactions need to be settle with an escrow like functionality.

The platform can be availed by the participating entities which can register themselves over initial chain, once validated; the participants can be enabled and connected to the Art Auction chain itself. Valid participants can perform their expected functions like creating assets, querying owner details, transfer ownerships, bid and buy over the platform.

By using block chain the system also becomes automatically time stamped and can be audited later. The block chain would also act as a record of all transactions and activities of all the players, acting as a check on fraudulent actors.

===== Section 3 - Requirements Not Related to User Stories =====

TBC

  - **Error Management** - As the number of nodes grow, there should be a way of detecting, routing and handling errors using standard and or custom error handlers for chaincode and business errors
  - **Event Management** - The auction application generates an event such as the expiry of an auction. Triggering an invoke from within a thread spawned by the chaincode violates the FSM. Hence, a better mechanism to listen to events and invoke appropriate actions on the chaincode is required
  - Both **UTC and Location management** should be supported on the Hyperledger Fabric. In the Auction Application, each peer may be in a different time zone and location , and their clocks may not be in sync when recording a transaction processed at the end of a timed event
  - Better techniques to **query the Blockchain database**. In the auction application, query by asset ID and query by asset category require two different tables and to improve efficiency, we duplicate the item information in both tables
