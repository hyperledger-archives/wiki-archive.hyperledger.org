===== Charter and FAQ =====
==== Scope ====
The activities of the TF-SIG include:
  * Identifying related reference architectures (for example Trade Finance business and integration architecture, technical and infrastructure architecture), frameworks and models (OSI), use cases, current pilots and proofs of concept, and production case studies;
  * Sharing stories of successes, failures, opportunities and challenges; 
  * Exploring and addressing cross-cutting architectural principles, options and decisions  like performance and scalability, security, identity management and privacy, and identity in trade finance contexts; 
  * Identifying existing or needed common critical software, middleware, and hardware components that would serve the particular needs of trade finance, including data transmission and processing from access point (device), through networks, and cloud computing deployment model options (private, public, hybrid)
  * Working towards proposing solutions to the problems identified;
  * Identifying conferences or other opportunities to connect face to face, as well as submit talks or present as a group at an event.
  * Identifying the business community and building an inclusive platform for early adopters to contribute with their experiences. 
  * Identifying all different protocols across trade finance portals with banking community, so as to build a standardisation across the different parties and efforts. 
  * Trade Facilitation, awareness of and working in accordance with such rules
 

<WRAP center round box 75%>
The TF-SIG is prohibited from performing or engaging in any form of lobbying or attempts to influence government policy making or regulatory processes.  It is also not intended as a platform for procurement of services.
</WRAP>

==== Work Products ====
The anticipated initial work products will include (but are not limited to) a set of documents describing trade finance use cases for blockchain technology. This will be an inventory of example use cases which captures common trade finance processes, which may suggest applications that are built or could be built using software being developed at Hyperledger. If existing inventories of such use cases exist, those should be identified and reviewed as well.  The TF-SIG should aim to identify common ground for collaboration between members, tackling the biggest challenges of the space. The TF-SIG may also host in-person meetings intended to accelerate the SIG's mission.
