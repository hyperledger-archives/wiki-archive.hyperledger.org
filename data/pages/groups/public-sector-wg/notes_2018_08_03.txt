Canadian government collaboration presentation:
     *Links are provided on the Use Case section of the PSWG wiki
     *How can Canadian government step up in it's role of providing trust in the economy?
          *Problem: Business people have to navigate a confusing number of requirements to open a business in British Columbia and Ontario. How can the government make it easier to for businesses to interact with government in a trustworthy basis?
              *Digital way to verify credentials
              *three governments collaborate - federal, BC, Ontario
              *20 applications on VON platform
              *Using Hyperledger Indy
          *General model - verifiable credentials model
              *high assurance identity card
              *individual owns credential
              *distributed keys management system
              *ledger helps manage public keys and enable exchange of verifiable credentials between peers
              *no data regarding transaction, no personal or business data on blockchain itself
         *Pattern
              *issuers / holders / verifiers
                   *documents like banking credential or marriage license used to gain access to services
              *What services can we issue from and issue to?
                   *Public business data is open information
                   *create verified credentials and give them a target to issue to
                   *TheOrgBook - simple directory of verifiable credentials about businesses
                   *In the future a business person would have her own digital wallet, this is a step toward that, but TheOrgBook is a community wallet
              *Business IDs are low hanging fruit to gain knowledge without tackling people's personal data
              *Single business registry - OrgBook
              *single code base between Ontario and BC
              *only display publicly available free information
              *use existing public infrastructure
              *searchable database - limited to corporations and D/B/A (Doing Business As)
              *digital signatures compared to blockchain
         *Future - permits, licenses, businesses will be able to share peer to peer on digital wallet
