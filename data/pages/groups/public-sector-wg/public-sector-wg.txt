===== Charter and FAQ =====
==== Scope ====
The activities of the Public-SIG  include:
  * identifying related use cases, current pilots, and proofs of concept;
  * sharing stories of successes, failures, opportunities, and challenges; 
  * exploring cross-cutting concerns like security, privacy, and identity in government contexts; 
  * identifying existing or needed common critical software components that would serve the particular needs of the public sector; 
  * identifying conferences or other opportunities to connect face to face, as well as submit talks or present as a group at an event.

This activity will be automatically recorded in email archives when conducted over the mailing list.  When this activity is conducted in other media, it will be captured as notes or other formats and posted to the list (so it is archived), or possibly to the Hyperledger Wiki.  This activity might also be turned into reports from the Special Interest group (recommendations to the rest of Hyperledger, for example) or other kinds of content (blog posts, content for publications, etc).

<WRAP center round box 75%>
The Public-SIG is prohibited from performing or engaging in any form of lobbying or attempts to influence government policy-making or regulatory processes.  It is also not intended as a platform for procurement of services. 
</WRAP>

==== Work Products ====
The initial work product will be a set of documents which analyze the space of government and regulatory use cases for blockchain technology. This will be an inventory of example use cases which captures common government processes, which may suggest applications that are built or could be built using software being developed at  Hyperledger. The public-sector-sig may also host in-person meetings intended to accelerate the Special Interest group's mission.
