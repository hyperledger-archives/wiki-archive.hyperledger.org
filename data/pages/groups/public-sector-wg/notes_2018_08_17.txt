Meeting Notes\\

1. Delaware State Use Case\\
     *We had a very engaging presentation from Pete Teigen of IBM, on the State of Delaware's exploration of corporate filings done over Hyperledger blockchain. This was a very interesting case, as Delaware is the legal home of 2/3 of US Fortune 500 companies. \\

     *We all look forward to Pete's next presentation, likely in October once the project has publicly launched. Pete will take us into the actual user interface and show code.\\

2. Hyperledger Project Overviews\\
     *Several participants expressed interest in learning more about the various Hyperledger Projects. Marta has kindly agreed to help bridge with the various communities, so that we can have ~ one presentation per call on each approach. To get us kicked off, John has very generously offered to provide a primer on Hyperledger Indy next call. Thanks, John!\\

3. Replacement of Legacy Systems\\
     *To kick off our next call, we will start with a great question from Kumar:\\

When doing a Proof of Concept (PoC), how do you handle getting information from existing systems, as well as the mechanics of actually replacing that system?\\

For those who have experience, questions, or an opinion on that question, please give some thought and consider sharing in the discussion next call.\\


Other Topics\\
The Use Case presentation format is proving to be popular and useful. If you are:\\

a) Working at any stage on a project and can discuss it, or\\
b) Considering Hyperledger, but have questions, need clarification, or would appreciate advice,\\

Please get in touch, either via group channels, or directly to me. Our group appreciates opportunities to learn, and has a lot of experience that all are willing to share.\\

Again, many thanks to all, and see you again soon on August 31st!\\
