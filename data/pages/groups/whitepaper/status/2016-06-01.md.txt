# Whitepaper WG Status 2016 Jun 01

* Majority of the meeting was spent discussing RGB's thoughtful feedback. We noted that Richard had grabbed a version of draft v.01 before we updated remainder of the OBC diagrams which led to some of the comments.
* We agreed to request updates to the hyperledger.org site to make the links to the whitepaper and feedback more visable.
* We discussed mechanisms to make feedback visible to the community (but ran out of time).
