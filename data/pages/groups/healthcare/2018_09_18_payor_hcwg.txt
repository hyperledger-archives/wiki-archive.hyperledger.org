Tony Little of Optum360 (United HealthGroup) presented the use case he has been working on in a consortium of health insurance companies on improving provider data accuracy on a  blockchain that many insurance companies can write to and access. A collaborative, permissioned blockchain. Problem: Payors collectively spend $2.1 Billion per year updating provider data and it still is only 65=75% accurate. The envisioned solution is a collaborative crowd sourced directory of provider data with incentives to reward crowdsourcing activities.
