Meeting Notes\\

Introductions
     *DOD and VA have a huge amount of historic effort in sharing information between the two agencies, as well as insurors and getting info from 3rd party and contract providers
     *Get clinical data from treatment areas and pass data back and forth to provide longitudinal care. 
     *Actual details from a clinical perspective. Looking for use cases to take part in.
     *Key challenge - providers move around a lot and as they move facilities and knowing what they can and cannot do
This group just got started and there are not many use cases yet, we are still trying to identify use cases.

There is a course on edx.org that is very helpful. [[https://www.edx.org/course/blockchain-business-introduction-linuxfoundationx-lfs171x-0|Blockchain for Business - An Introduction to Hyperledger Technologies]]

Not clear from business standpoint how the technology will apply, looking for use cases to figure that out, what kinds of use cases are best

Need to include someone from the Identity working group to talk about patient privacy.
Sequencing of use cases is critical.
Quorum for white paper planning
