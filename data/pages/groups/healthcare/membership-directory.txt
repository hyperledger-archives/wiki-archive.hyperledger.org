==== Connect with Other HC-SIG Members ====


As part of our ongoing review of the HC-SIG and our drive to provide value to both current and prospective HC-SIG members, we've developed this membership directory. The purpose of this directory is to make it easier for HC-SIG members to connect with one another and their respective businesses and organizations.

This is a purely voluntary effort, but if you're interested in posting your professional contact information, and you didn't receive a request to participate through email, here's what you need to do:

  - Log into the [[https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/healthcare-sig|HC-SIG Rocket.Chat channel]] (you'll need to create a Linux Foundation account)
  - Send a direct message to //richbl//, providing the following information:

    * Your name (required)
    * A social media URL to your name (optional, e.g., Linkedin)
    * Your company name (optional)
    * Your company website URL (optional, corporate divisions or specific areas of your company website are permitted)
    * Your company title (optional)
    * Your geographic location (optional, using the format of "city, country")

You'll receive an email confirming the addition of your name to the membership directory (usually within 24 hours). Please be sure to double-check your entry for accuracy.
