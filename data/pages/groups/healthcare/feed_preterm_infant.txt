==== Name ====

** Feed preterm infant **

==== Narrative ====

Following a preterm delivery, a newborn is transferred to the Neonatal ICU. Based on a clinical assessment, the responsible practitioner decides to place a dietary order for human milk.

The [[human_milk_recipient_services|Human milk recipient services]] workflow is initiated, during which 
a prescription is generated and sent to one of the affiliated milk banks. The healthcare provider submits relevant details from the patientâ€™s diagnostic and health history. The milk bank manager acknowledges receiving the prescription and health records and initiates review of the request. Once approved, the order is prioritized on a delivery queue, and filled by the milk distributor.

The milk is received and dispensed according to the patient's dietary orders.
