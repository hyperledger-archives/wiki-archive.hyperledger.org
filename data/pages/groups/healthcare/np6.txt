Introductions\\
     *Marissa is working with Nate on where folks can input their emails/LinkedIn profiles.\\
     *Communication channels are chat (see above) and Healthcare WG DL\\
     *Pls use #patient-member-subgroup (in subject line for emails) to be able to filter subgroup work out of general WG comms\\

Where are our interests?\\
     *Interests in the group included clinical trials, laboratory/sample use cases, mail order prescriptions, identity credentials, cell phone smartcard integration for public distribution of healthcare funds, imaging
     *Cris showed interest in submitting a proposal for the Hyperledger Global Forum for a fertility/sample use case. Template for use case is here:https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/requirements/use-case-template\\
          *Please let her know if you are interested in collaborating\\
          *Anyone else up for the challenge? We'd love to drive to the July 13th submission deadline with you!\\
What is our goal? Select use cases to pursue and roles people what to take on\\
     *Strong feedback that we need to be focus on building "solid effective code written/documented/fully useable"; concern raised about having technical resources to complete projects, but Vishnu offered to help with development and we can work to find other resources\\
When are we going to get there? Target timeline....would we possibly consider a submission to the Hyperledger Global Forum or some other target?\\
What is our cadence moving forward?\\
     *Meetings have been put on the community calendar for every 2 weeks @ same time: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=linuxfoundation.org_nf9u64g9k9rvd9f8vp4vur23b0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/SanFrancisco
