</WRAP>

===== Introductions =====

  * **If you’re new to the subgroup, please…** 
    * Introduce yourself
    * Tell us where you're geographically located
    * Share with us your interests in healthcare in general, and blockchain technologies in specific, with emphasis in EHR/EMRs

===== Community Announcements =====

  * **Feel free to share your community announcements as they relate to the Hyperledger community**

===== Old Business =====

  * Status from Ad Hoc Subgroup Review Team (Benjamin Djidi, Mikhail Elias, Steven Elliot, Robert Coli, and Sonia Wagner, Lead)
  * * **Discussion: continued discussions of understanding the focus of this subgroup, and the broader implications of approaching our work from a different perspective**

  * Confirmation that the EMR Subgroup, as previously defined, should be disbanded
    * **Discussion: recommendations/nominations?**

<WRAP box>
  * It's the decision of the active members of the EMR Subgroup, and the larger Ad Hoc Subgroup Review Team to disband the subgroup in the shorter term, as its initial charter/purpose, as stated, was unclear
  * Rich will follow up with Hyperledger leadership to determine how best to make use of this meeting time slot
  * This decision does not suggest that the HLHC-SIG will not entertain a future motion to reconstitute a SIG subgroup with a focus on EHR/EMRs
</WRAP>

===== New Business =====

  * ** Discussion: "a bottom up approach" email follow up (Steven Elliot)**


<WRAP box>
  * Good general discussion around how a future subgroup will need to consider a more global (non-US) understanding of healthcare systems, whether public or private: we cannot be limited to a purely US-centric view of healthcare solutions (Mikhail)
  * High level of continuing interest in an Interoperability Subgroup, or some form of communications channel that takes into account the cross-cutting nature of healthcare interoperability and blockchain technologies (Steven)
  * Also a continued interest expressed in a future Public Health Subgroup, depending in large part on how the SIG re-aligned itself going forward (Mikhail)
  * Bob introduced the group to the Healthcare Services Platform Consortium (HSPC), indicating that this group is doing some similar work with interoperability
  * HSPC has some very big players in this space: Commonwell Health Alliance, Intermountain Healthcare, Care Equality, Cerner (creator), and others
  * A mention that the HSPC might be tightly-wedded with Cerner (the #2 EHR vendor in the US)
  * No known work being done in the HSPC using blockchain technologies
  * Also a note that the HSPC might be US-centric (a counterpoint that there's work being done with the HSPC in Africa)
  * Steven indicated that it'd be useful to consider the HSPC as a good resource in the future, perhaps a collaborator on some kind of future Hyperledger healthcare project/service
  * Blockchain technologies using AI/predictive analytics/machine learning may be another area of future SIG subgroup interest
  * Mention that India is significantly growing their investments in country-wide healthcare systems, many solutions heavily tech-centric
  * Sonia asked and agreed to continue to lead the Ad Hoc Subgroup Review Team
  * Sonia urged that we need to push to generate something concrete (a project or POC), but we need goals at the SIG level
  * Rich indicated that this team (Ad Hoc team) will need to push the discussion "up" to the SIG level to engage membership, and particularly subgroup leads
  * This EMR Subgroup focus needs to segue into a broader, membership-wide discussion that looks at SIG level changes in the coming year (2019)
  * Mikhail asked that it would be good to put together some kind of plan or shorter-term goal (Steven in agreement)
  * Some discussion on perhaps some level of confusion between what this team is proposing going forward ("what's the take-away?")
  * Steven indicated that we should be focussed on developing a architecture for pluggable services
  * Sonia indicated that she believes that all subgroup leads do need to understand what this team is proposing
  * Some disconnect on where this Ad Hoc team needs to go next (need "clarity of vision" and another meeting before 12/14)
</WRAP>
===== Next Meeting =====

  * Scheduled for Tuesday, 12/18, 0800 Pacific Time
  * **Discussion: topics to add to agenda?**
