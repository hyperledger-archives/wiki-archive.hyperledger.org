Linux Foundation Antitrust reminder: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy 

     *Pre auth doesn’t seem like an appropriate blockchain use case
     *Rich can present on value based care soon
     *Need more SME’s to see if the problem is really blockchain appropriate or not
     *Don’t think donor milk is a good test case for blockchain, SME says no problems
