Next Steps from last meeting for reference:

  * Marissa to send Vaibhav with 1-pager that he can share with healthcare connections in the US. The 1-page that was sent to IBM can be found - [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_1YbskFv8Lh9a0NjzLpjGpthi5Uc2rIxVE8oApV9WaI/edit|here]]
  * Mikhail to put together a high level summary of possible impact at the Global, Community, and Hospital level that Tony can then take to try to put into a "pitch deck" to present to possible groups of interest.
  * Possible organizations that might be interested in collaborating might are Gates Foundation, WHO, Vital Strategy (Bloomberg Philanthropy).

Notes from Ben:

Today we discussed the customer traction for the Donor Milk project. The POC is currently stranded due to the loss of our main customer's buy-in but we are looking into options and have started actively reaching out to potential new customers for the project. For instance, Vaibhav has reached out to a number of his contacts in the space and Rich will be promoting the group at HIMS. The current proposal is to park the Donor Milk project if we haven't collected sufficient traction by the end of Feb (after the HIMS conf). This does not mean that we shouldn't actively look for other customers in the meantime (best case scenario we'll end up with a project pipeline).

The follow up actions that we concluded out of the call were:
- Let's document the work done so far and the different leads and statuses [I'll sync with Marissa to get this rolling]
- We will need to standard the communication for the Donor Milk project outreach and the SIG in general to streamline our lead generation pipeline, does anybody want to give it a go?
- There was some work done on getting a charter and transcribing the broader vision for the group, I'll pick this up and see where we are.
