===== Charter and FAQ =====

The [[https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HealthcareWGCharter_public.pdf|Charter]] defines the scope and ways that work together.  Some brief [[https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HyperledgerHealthcareWGFAQ-3.pdf|FAQs help answer questions]] as the WG gets started.

===== Communication Tools =====
  * [[https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/healthcare-wg | healthcare-wg mailing list]]
  * [[https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/healthcare-wg | #healthcare-wg chat channel]]


===== Preliminary Survey =====

The WG ran a [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6mdXdapkyrHRF96NDlsX19Wc0k/view|preliminary survey]] showing areas that participants are interested in working with blockchains to improve healthcare operations.

===== Use Case Inventory =====

There are several healthcare use cases that are in the [[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/requirements/use-case-inventory|hyperledger use case inventory.]]

They are copied here as a convenience (and should be removed) because this Wiki does not seem to implement anchors.
