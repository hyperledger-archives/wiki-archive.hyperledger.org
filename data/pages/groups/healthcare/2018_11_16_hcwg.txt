===== HLHCWG Guest Speaker =====
  * [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-zhovnuvaty-88004026/|Alex Zhovnuvaty]], CTO of RideChain, and the creator of [[https://github.com/AlexZhovnuvaty/sawtooth-healthcare|Sawtooth Healthcare]], a blockchain application built on Hyperledger Sawtooth, allowing clinics to keep history regarding patients health and claims on the blockchain, will present to membership to gauge interest in his solution.

<WRAP box>
  * Alex has a background in IT and startups particularly in the ride-sharing space
  * Use flow is for an individual with a "claim" to a healthcare provider, gets prescribes treatment (tests, medication, procedure), patient gets treatment, gets a follow up visit, and claim is followed until 'claim' is satisfied
  * Qualities of blockchain to be leveraged: Immutability, Transparency, and Finality
  * It can be expanded to a variety of use cases including insurance company claims, malpractice validation, physician reviews, data sharing between clinics, etc.
  * The project is currently in GitHub (see link above)
  * Currently only Alex and one junior developer is working on this

Team feedback:
  * This seems like a multitude of projects as each use case has different requirements and really is "Sawtooth for Healthcare"
  * How is data privacy protected through a private blockchain network would help prevent this
  * Silona recommends coordinating with the Indy privacy DID work to ensure they understand the use cases and can work towards to solution
  * Access control is also an issue for having data on the blockchain - (i.e. the patient is unconcious and can't give permission to access data)
  * TO DO: Rich to follow up on what is defined as a "sponsor" - the question is also if there is financial support for Labs

</WRAP>
