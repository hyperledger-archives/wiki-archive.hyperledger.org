Linux Foundation Antitrust reminder: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy 

Chris Cole is a pre auth SME
     *Works at Care First 9 years - create population health tools
     *Director in provider application space
What’s an authorization?
     *Prior authorization - based on some set of rules, or other mandates, laws
     *Who submits pre auth? The person who wants to get paid is accountable (hospital itself)\\
     *In patient notification - restricted to member is going to be hospitalized, skilled nursing, confinement of some kind
1. determine whether you need prior auth
     *This member needs this service, and now I want to understand if some kind of permission is required
2. seeking the requests - put info together, here’s everything about the service i want to provide and is it approved\\
3. I submitted request and i want to understand the status of the request\\
4. sometimes more records are required based on what you asked to do. Follow on query\\

I want to have a knee surgery
     *Are all the elements around the member themself - (date of birth, etc.)
     *Check eligibility - (active coverage? Which product?)
     *Where is the surgery going to be done? Each setting has unique rules. 
     *What? Procedure is knee surgery, these certain codes are associated
     *Why? Damage or problems, Diagnosis codes
     *Date/s? How many units during what time period?
     *Billing provider - ABC surgical assoc is the biller
     *Rendering doctor - Dr Jones\\


We may ask for additional information - particular codes sent in trigger a questionnaire or to upload certain types of records - clinic team to access the request needs additional information

     *This entire request is wrapped into one data ball and gets a unique identifier then it’s routed, business rules engine, routed to a reviewer set,general surgical review, work queue and a person is going to apply some clinical judgment on this
     *If it’s approved there is generally a clock counting down to the final decision
     *Approved or denied
          *If approved, electronically we notify the asker
          *If denied, more rules and regulations
          *Right of appeal
          *Why was this denied?
          *Any other kinds of information about what they can do about the negative decision
     *If in authorization I wanted to do knee procedures A and B
           *Say yes to one and no to the other - called partial 
           *The no is treated like a denial with right of appeal, etc
           *
Flag, routine, emergent, emergency\\
Behavioral health and emergency requests are turned over very quickly  \\

As people do their job through the pool, status changes are reflected\\

Pain points?\\
     *A lot of the things we talked about rely on a person coming to a screen to do part of it. Standardized transactions have more latitude
     *A lot to like around making this space more standard, picking up the pace, reducing manual touch points
     *A custom set of questions is not supported - non standard is a problem
     *What are the scenarios you feel are not standard? If there is an exchange of information on blockchain that eliminate issues?
     *Once something is pre approved, how long does it take to get paid? Information is sent to the claim platform in real time. Claim platform is waiting for a claim that matched. Claim comes in, this service matches the authorization, claim paid
     *Outcome - part of your benefit requirement, line up at point of payment, if I can’t do that then it’s not a good process
     *Precision on authorizations is used to predict upcoming expenses
     *What percentage are handled manually v automatically?
          *60% based around benefit design, goes through without human intervention
          *With the right additional info you could increase that percentage
          *If you authorize something 100% of the time, why are you requiring a pre auth? \\


Next steps: what areas can blockchain be applied to?
