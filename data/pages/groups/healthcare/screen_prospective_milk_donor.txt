==== Name ====

** Screen donor **

==== Narrative ====

The prospective donor has contacted the milk bank and undergoes screening. 

The screener conducts an in-person or phone interview in order to elicit and document the donor’s health status and history. 

The screener sends the prospective donor additional educational information for review, along with a consent form to undergo further screening steps.

The donor undergoes laboratory testing for a defined panel of diagnostic tests.  

The donor’s healthcare provider certifies that the prospective donor has met the necessary criteria for milk donation. The donor’s infant’s healthcare provider also certifies that the prospective donor has met the criteria for milk donation.

The milk bank's practitioners review the donor’s documentation and certify the prospective donor is qualified to donate milk.
