    * Confirmed: Change Healthcare (https://www.changehealthcare.com/) to present at upcoming HLHCWG General Meeting
    * In talks with a technology attorney willing to speak on technology IP and open source collaborations

//Rich is working to get dates on bringing Mark, an IP lawyer, and also Change Healthcare who is using Hyperledger Fabric//

  * Update on academic research in the Hyperledger Project, specifically within healthcare (Adrian)
    * Plan is to develop a proposal/presentation and submit to TSC
    * Team: Adrian Berg and Mikhail Elias

//Adrian provided an update - they have created a summary document that will be presented to the TSC. There are several options that they are proposing: replace the whitepaper working group with a research working group, ad hoc research, review of PoCs, etc. There is some reorganization of how the working groups report up to the TSC, but that might not be the case moving forward.

//Rayne confirmed that Confluence is coming soon. Next big step is when we migrate over to Confluence, we'll be able to leverage the JIRA/Confluence connectivity to our advantage for the donor milk use cases or other things

Rich will send out an email asked for any feedback by next week before we cutover to the new landing page for the HCWG//

F. New Business

  * A review of the HLHCWG Charter
    * Current charter is out of date (c. 2016) with newer HLWG charter template
    * Our charter:
      * https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HealthcareWGCharter_public.pdf
    * New charter template:
      * https://docs.google.com/document/d/16GJw2cxXf_Sw1DFbsInkgQ1jy_eXxteUgKdge09jw-k/view 
    * Newer template will better capture HLHCWG mission statement/scope, and deliverables
    *** Discussion: what is our mission statement?**

//Rich would like to see the Charter revised so that we have a succession plan and allow others to get involved at the leadership level.//

//We need to go from our current charter and revise with the template. Rich proposes doing a committee to draft it and then bring it back to the group.//

//Committee will be Rich, Ken Allgood, Leonard Edwin with Adrian Berg and Marissa Iannarone to review before we bring it back to the group.//

//Part of this rewrite will be looking at how we can present a value proposition for SMEs that we are looking to bring in.//

//The Healthcare working group should be able to provide feedback to Hyperledger if the tools are not adding value to the healthcare space and that we're actively using these tools and that we communicate up the challenges that we face up to TSC leadership//

  * A discussion of new HLHCWG subgroups
    *** Discussion: do we need new subgroups?**

G. Next Meeting
  * Scheduled for Friday, 11/02, 0700 Pacific Time
  * **Discussion: topics to add to agenda?**
