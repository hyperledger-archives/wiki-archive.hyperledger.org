Meeting Notes\\

At a high-level we:\\
     *Reviewed our Connecting Patient Data Across Silos for Diagnostics and Treatment use case and how to engage with a build while not duplicating the work of another Hyperledger effort: Medicalchain (all notes have been added to the wiki page above and we are looking forward to getting some questions answered at the 7/27 HCWG meeting if a Medicalchain representative is available)\\
     *Discussed the donor milk proof of concept (POC) that Anton Ansalmar and Ron Block with Rapid Healthcare presented and are looking to build - If anyone knows of any donor milk use cases being explored in other Hyperledger projects, please let us know\\
     *Decided that the donor milk use case and POC is what the patient/member subgroup would like to pursue as top priority, and to track to the Hyperledger Global Forum timeline for completion
Outcomes of the meeting:\\
     *A use case has been created on the Hyperledger wiki that includes major points and references from yesterday's conversation (please feel free to add anything that I might have missed: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/healthcare/donor_milk_transparency_and_traceability
     *I had mentioned Rocket.Chat during the meeting - see here where you can connect to specific channels: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/chat_channels \\
     *Anton will send over initial architecture documentation for the subgroup to review - I will post it on the wiki when it is received\\
Next steps:\\
     *If you would like to be identified as a member of the patient/member subgroup of the healthcare working group, please add your LinkedIn profile or other method of contact for the group here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/healthcare/patient_subgroup\\
     *For our 8/3 meeting we will review any updates to the donor milk use case that we have, timeline, and engagement from the developer and identity working groups (Vipin Bharatham (@vipinb) who leads the Identity working group has offered to join one of our meetings to answer any questions we have, but my suggestion is to have him join on 8/17 so that we have an opportunity to collect questions) \\
