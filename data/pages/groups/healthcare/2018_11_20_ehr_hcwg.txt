===== Introductions =====

===== Old Business =====

  * Status on current work efforts
  * * **Discussion: open discussion on expectations and direction of this subgroup**

<WRAP box>
  * Discussion of past EMR Subgroup meetings
  * Sonia and Rich attended the last known EMR Subgroup meeting (10/02), which is believed to have been the last meeting of the subgroup
  * Past meeting emphasized an EMR solution from the provider perspective
  * Expectation is that the current work on our HLHCWG charter review/revision will help set the proper tenor going forward
  * Question about the distinction between EMRs and EHRs
    * EHRs are a broader interpretation of electronic health records management, while...
    * EMRs are typically a subset of an EHR, generally provider-facing, used in provider practices (satellite to larger healthcare systems)

  * Larger question of whether this subgroup focus on EHRs or the provider (harmonizing with the other subgroups: patient and payer)
    * Concept surfaced of whether it makes sense to view use cases from the end-user perspective (application layer / top down)
      * What if we viewed our work as bottom up, more as a provider of a healthcare platform of services?
      * Cross-cutting issues of data management, security, and interoperability fall into the context of this approach
      * Implications touch all current subgroups
      * Important to maintain an understanding that WGs exist to drive issues in the proper context (in this case, healthcare) up to Hyperledger leadership such that architectural/feature improvements can be made to improve frameworks/toolsets
    * Public healthcare could be one way to rescope the focus for this (or another, separate) subgroup

</WRAP>

===== New Business =====

  * Seeking new lead for this subgroup
    * **Discussion: recommendations/nominations?**

<WRAP box>
  * From the good discussions from today's meeting, the group has decided to spin up an ad hoc committee to do some additional due diligence in advance of the next meeting
    * Sonia has volunteered to serve as lead for this team, with Ben and Mikhail working with Sonia
    * Rich will loop Steven Elliot (not in attendance) into the team, as Steven and Mikhail have complementary thoughts
  * Our next meeting will continue the discussion about how best to shape the charter of this subgroup going forward
</WRAP>


===== Next Meeting =====

  * Scheduled for Tuesday, 12/04, 0800 Pacific Time
  * **Discussion: topics to add to agenda?**
