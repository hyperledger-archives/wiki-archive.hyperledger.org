Meeting Notes\\

Introductions
     *Timeline for a product 3-5 years
     *We need to be keeping meeting notes so we can keep up when we can’t attend
     *Think through whether to get into a use case now or whether to create a framework for use cases
          *Three good use cases to focus on
          *Need to work on whitepaper
     *Tony Little Optim working on provider solution for credential - use case the farthest along
     *When is blockchain effective? A paper on the conditions where blockchain is useful would be very good
     *Eligibility for Medicaid, we had to figure out a way to change eligibility on a daily basis, complex problem
     *posting all vital signs to the blockchain and figured out that was not useful, we only needed to post outlying vitals to the blockchain
     *Is blockchain HIPAA compliant? Can we store any patient information in the hyperledger blockchain without getting into trouble?
     *That’s why we should start with a whitepaper so we understand the landscape
          *	Inform us and the audience as marketing
          *	Identify one or two use cases we could run with
     *VA is going to let vets start seeing doctors outside the VA, that’s a use case that’s manageable.  Self contained. It’s a lot of people with identifiers and a lot of moving parts, but they all have identifiers that are well defined. Blockchain between enterprises.
