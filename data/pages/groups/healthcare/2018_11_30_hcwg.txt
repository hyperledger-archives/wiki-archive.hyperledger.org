===== HLHC-SIG Guest Speaker(s) =====
  * Speaking on the topic of enterprise collaboration and sensitive information sharing in an open-source business context, we have the following guests joining us:
    * Ken Moyle, Technology Attorney with [[https://www.k6partners.com/|K6 Partners]] is a board member and Chair of the Public Policy Committee for the Electronic Signature & Records Association (ESRA) 
    * Bryan McWhorter, Partner at [[https://www.knobbe.com/|Knobbe Martens]], Seattle, Washington, USA. Bryan focuses on patent procurement and dispute resolution, particularly for companies in the software, telecommunications, and food and beverage areas.  

<WRAP box>
* Enterprise collaboration (how do we approach selective sharing IP)

  * Presenters:
    * Ken Moyle, Chair of Public Policy Committee for Electronic Signature and Records Association
    * Bryan McWhorter, IP attorney at Knobbe Martens

  * Copyrights vests in creator unless explicit transfer via "work for hire" contract or clause in employment agreement (in most jurisdictions)
  * Copyrights don't require formal registration
  * General Public License ("copyleft") open-source agreements require anyone who uses and/or enhances code to make it publicly available
    * Consider it like a virus: once infected, it spreads to anything that it touches
    * Lesser General Public License agreement allows some ability to retain private rights of open-source software that is enhanced by private parties
      * Mozilla license  -- provide least ability for private licenses
      * Apache license  -- greater ability to patent enhancements (Hyperledger uses Apache 2.0 license)

  * Apache 2.0 tends to be viral -- all derivative works are covered by Apache 2.0
  * Patent rights are automatically granted under this
  * If you provide code to Hyperledger, anyone can use it without copyright and you give up patent protection rights, you can still create unique derivative works and copyright them
  * It includes a promise not to sue people who use Apache 2.0 software for patent infringement
    * MIT license  -- most ability for private use
    * Unlicense -- merely limits liability

  * Two issues
    * What are the limitations for me to use it?
    * What are the limitations for me to capitalize my IP built on top of open-source licensed code?

  * Patents vs copyrights
    * Patents cover "ideas"
    * Copyrights cover code

  * Questions
    * What's benefit of patent vs cheaper copyright?
      * Copyright covers only code, not the concept which could be implemented using different code
