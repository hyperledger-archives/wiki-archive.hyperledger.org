===== HLHCWG Subgroup Updates =====

  * Patient/Member Subgroup (Marissa Iannarone, Lead)

>  * //Every other Fridays from 9 to 10 AM (PST)//
>  * //Michael Johnson provided an update from Donor milk use case some interviews from people dealing with this first hand.//
>  * //Milk banks want to hear how their product is being used (help them match supply in ways that better meet needs)//
>  * //Atrium health reported no contamination issues. (pure supply line)//
>  * //The goal is to build extensible supply chain patterns to help others use for their use cases//
>  * //Code development is in progress using Fabric//
>
> //Excerpt from the chat channel (https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/healthcare-wg/)://\\
> The patient-member subgroup continues to work with the donor milk use case. Michael Johnson and I conducted an interview with a dietitian responsible for all NICU feeding (including donor milk) for a major hospital. Notes can be found here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/healthcare/donor_milk_transparency_and_traceability#section_6_-_interview_results Other than supply limitations and seeing value of knowing caloric density of milk, no problem spaces emerged. I think we need to try and do similar interviews and collect more data. I talked to Ben and he is willing to talk through a revision of the CTO file, but we want to ensure that any simplification of the file doesn't limit real world applicability. Ben also mentioned trying to find some organizations that would be willing to pilot this with us, if anyone is interested in working to build those relationships.

  * Payer Subgroup (Raveesh Dewan, Lead)


> * //Progress made on the “Decision matrix” to help people separate the hype: Is blockchain right for you?//
> * //Expectation is to abstract out the decision tree for all groups to use across various use cases//
>  * //Weekly meeting on Tuesday 2 to 3 PM (ET)//

  * EMR Subgroup (Robert Chu, Lead)

> //Not in attendance: no report//

===== New Business =====

  * A discussion of new HLHCWG subgroups (Rich)
    *** Discussion: do we need new subgroups?**

> //No new subgroups needed at this time, but if we do, we can spin them up rather quickly. Once created, they need to be appropriately staffed and managed.//

  * Healthcare technologies challenges (Rich)
      * Upcoming opportunities: [[https://www.herox.com/Differential-Privacy-Synthetic-Data-Challenge|NIST Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge]], [[http://www.kidneyx.org/|KidneyX Redesign Dialysis Prize Competition]]
    *** Discussion: are these worthwhile pursuits?**

> // Good discussion, particularly around the KidneyX competition. Rich has offered to work with Seattle area leadership to identify where we might leverage our understanding of issues. Currently still unclear if there is enough motivation/resources within HLHCWG to proceed.//
>
> * //Kidney X Redesign Dialysis Prize ($1m)//
> * //Ripe for innovation – medical technology created in Seattle in 1960 and relatively unchanged today.//
> * //Analog recording and transmission telemetry (record 30-minute intervals of general health)//
> * //Payment model is slow and complicated//
> * //Not expecting to develop new clinical methods, but rather, improving the patient experience and possibly the payment model/pains//

  * A HIPAA-compliant Hyperledger (Rich)
    *** Discussion: a great idea... how best to proceed?**

> //Next meeting: continue discussion around defining “HIPAA” compliance and how to validate claims from blockchain platforms readiness//
