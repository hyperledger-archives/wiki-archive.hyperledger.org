Linux Foundation Antitrust reminder: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy

     *We need more SME information about the pre auth process
          *More complete picture what happened inside the payor when going thru the steps for approval and denial 
          *Process re-engineering outside of Blockchain
          *Many process issues we’ll end up getting into 
          *Is it possible to codify the approval and rejection steps more automatically\\

Arrange for SME next week to talk about auth process in detail
     *Slight variation in plans cause people to get different treatment for the same ailment
          *Coverage question, not blockchain question
     *Is this a good use case for blockchain or not?
          *Blockchain opportunity
               *Two channels
               *Public channel
               *Private channel
     *Simplify view 
         *Medication pre auth
              *IVF pre auth required
              *Dr Request payor pre auth
              *Requires supplement information to decide whether medically necessary and give pre auth
              *Reject - we need more info
              *More info comes in 
              *Pre auth given
         *When approved or not approved, you go to get service, you have a strong record it was pre approved, no hold up in payment
              *Menu - your approval plus your insurance plan allows you to see these providers at this percentage of coverage
                   *Patient choose dr and has service
                   *Link record of approval and demonstrate service has been rendered, get payment instantaneously 
                   *Ideally it’s a smart contract
     *Way to speed up pre auth process, one thing you could do is a link of record or hash of records submitted 
          *What exactly are we managing? Data remains outside the chain
          *First transaction on blockchain - request from known provider for known patient for known service  submitted - immutable
     *We need to know more about the process and how it derails
          *Is there a benefit for transactions to be public on demand?
          *Query on chain for auth for services I’ve asked for
          *Patient results
     *How do public transaction help me?
     *How is blockchain better than a regular database?
     *I’m a patient waiting, instead of looking every day I get a payor provided blockchain app that I can register 
myself to and once that transaction has happened I’m notified on my distributed application
     *Authorization for certain lab test
          *Auth goes in smart contract
          *Lab provides results for that patient
          *Instant payment instead of normal cycle
          *Traceability / any better than a trigger on an Oracle database
          *Data inherently immutable then that makes more sense for blockchain that a central database wouldn’t have
     *Prevent medical fraud is at the top of the needs
     *Prior auth is a hot topic, everyone is sick of broken process
          *Slower they have to pay the longer they get to live on the money
          *If they deny authorization, then no pay
          *Even if it’s just in limbo, who benefits from this, not the patient, it’s the payor who benefits from how complicated it is
     *Having a public ledger doesn’t seem to have a benefit
     *Immutability seems to have some benefit
     *Does chain code bring a compelling benefit? 
          *Convoluted process all stakeholders want to get thru faster, payor has to pay interest when too slow
     *We really need a SME to get depth to the process
          *Every payor is focused on the first pass rate, in an automated untouched pattern can I get this approved or denied without delay
     *Pain points with insurers is identifying patients between separate systems
          *Universal ID
          *ID a person across health care systems, does exist as a blockchain
          *25 step process to identify patients, so many combinations to say, yep we own that patient
     *Value based care is huge
          *History is lost with patient movement between providers / payors
     *Next steps - get and SME for pre auth and one for Value based care
          *Need to start solidifying
          *Create a framework to get to the next level
          *Get the right problem to be solved first
          *Define workflow, develop methodology
