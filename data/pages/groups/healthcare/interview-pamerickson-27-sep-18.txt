----------

  * Pam is a NICU lactation consultant at one of the largest healthcare facility within a healthcare system that has over 900 facilities
  * She is specialized due to the size of the facility with NICU lactation consultants and in-patient lactation consultants being distinct roles; her focus is on mother's milk, not donor milk
  * At smaller facilities, lactation consultant responsibilities includes management of donor milk as well as mother's milk
  * Pam has offered to take an advisory role moving forward, and she is going to refer us to the dietician that manages the donor milk in the facility
  * As a NICU lactation consultant, if a mother's supply is good and might expire or if there has been an infant loss, they offer donation as an option
    *  They refer mothers to WakeMed Donor Bank and they have fliers that they pass along
    * They do not do donation collection within the facility
  * If a baby or mother is transferred to another facility within the healthcare system, the mother's milk has to be relabeled facility to facility - an opportunity to standardize the labeling across the full healthcare system
  * When Mother's bring in their milk for their baby in the NICU, there are kiosks where the mothers can check in the milk; they use a barcode labeling system
  * Expiration of milk
    * In the NICU in deep freezers milk can hold up to 6 months
    * At home in deep freezers the recommendation is 6-12 months
  * Donor milk is the responsibility of the dietician on staff who manages the supply with donor banks and the milk preparation onsite
    * There is informal sharing of donated milk across facilitates within the healthcare system and visibility on supply could be better - an opportunity to improve the donor milk network between facilities within the same system
