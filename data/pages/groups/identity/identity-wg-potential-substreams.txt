The following are raw notes from a part of the Identity Management Working Group meeting that was held at a session hosted by the DTCC on May 5, 2016 on potential sub-streams within the working group.

==== I - Commons and Principles ====

  - Self-Sovereign Identity
    - Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/ChristopherA/identity-of-the-blockchain-perils-and-promise
    - 10 Principles and some history: http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html
    - ID 2020 Summit on Digital Identity at United Nations May 20th http://id2020summit.org
    - #RebootingWebOfTrust Design Workshop after UN Summit May 21st & 22nd http://www.WebOfTrust.info 
  - Ostrom's work - Where tragedy of the commons didn't happen
    - A Revised “Ostrom’s Design Principles for Collective Governance of the Commons”: http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/11/a-revised-ostroms-design-principles-for-collective-governance-of-the-commons-.html
  - Taxonomy
    - What are the different terms of art in the existing communities of practice, and which more accurately represent our vision?
    - Subject / issuer
    - Entitlements
    - Credential / assertion
  - Boaty mcboatface
  - Non-repudiation of transaction / event
  - Onboarding / Bootstraping Process
  - Life cycle of identity
  - HLTP - What's most useful leanest

==== II - Federation - Permission-less, Permissioned or Mix ====

  - Layerings
  - Permissioned networks
  - Peer question
  - Additive homomorphic
  - Boot strapping
  - Liquid - bitcoin exchanges - very fast transfers among exchanges
  - Permissioned blockchain
  - Create keys together for exchanges
  - No one can cheat for keys in trust zone
  - Shared key generation
  - Zcash
  - Selective encryption
  - Parameter for a curve
  - Snhore
  - Maxwell's tree of ?
  - Multi-sigs
  - Voting
  - Multi-sig versus threshold sigs
  - Design constraints on federation participant
  - Abstractions
  - Paxos
  - When add or change members 
  - Nature of the consensus mechanism may change
  - Bootstrapping a permissioned network
  - Consensus federation changes

==== III - Fiduciary Code and Signing ====

  - Permissions
  - Approved by
  - Successful validation
  - How prove fiduciary met
  - How prove transparency met
  - Implementation code failures
  - How to attest to the hardware
  - Consensus for integrity of the ledger
  - VM
  - Multi-factor authentication
  - Software-defined networking example vs. juniper networks
  - Delegation

==== IV - Failure ====

  - Individual key loss
  - China shuts down great firewall for 3 days
  - Hierarchical Deterministic Keys
  - Bitcoin uses 3 of 6 variants
  - Powerful/mature technology
  - Audit every child of that key
  - Master key offline and can be revoked
  - Hyperledger currently
  - CA authority generates
  - To handle auditability for b2b case
  - Every transaction has unique public key
  - Social network reboot
  - Proof of existence
  - Reboot of identity
  - Multi-sig network recovery
  - Consumer with list of friends - backup buddies if I lose my phone
  - If I lose my Yubi key, 2 people from IT can recovery
  - Smart contracts level of indirection from crypto identifier and private keys that control the system
  - Replace/rotate keys without changing identifier
  - Pluggable element for control of identity
  - Three days of inactivity then go to recovery procedure
  - Trusted computational fabric enabled by 
  - Nonrepudiation if can't recreate keys
  - New key versus re-generating old key
  - Core ideas for how identities interact then works for use cases (e.g., consumer/retail, business-to-business)

==== V - Confidentiality, Privacy ====

  - Selective disclosure, blinding, uprove, identity mixer, zero-knowledge proofs / homomorphic proofs
  - Confidential transactions
  - Front running

==== VI - Legacy ====

  * Existing identity systems

==== VII - Visioning the Future ====

  * N/A
