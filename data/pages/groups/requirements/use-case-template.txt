===== Use Case Title =====

==== Section 1 - Intro ====

=== Overview of the Business Problem or Opportunity ===

''Please explain the business problem or opportunity in business terms without technical jargon, and without mention of a distributed ledger.''

=== Current Solution ===

''If there are systems in place today which automate the above business problem/opportunity, please explain what exists.''

=== Why Distributed Ledger Technology? ===

''Please explain how distributed ledger technology would improve the current solutions (if they exist) or enable new solutions which were previously unavailable. The goal here is to ensure we do not have a solution looking for problems, but problems where solutions would become possible or significantly improved by using distributed ledger technology.''

=== Opportunity/Justification ===

''Use this section to give details that support the value of pursuing these user stories using distributed ledger technology. Some examples of information that might be included here are applicable market segments, workloads, user bases, etc. and any associated data.''

==== Section 2 -  User Stories and Requirements ====

''Please explain this use case using actors and interactions and assuming the ideal distributed ledger technology exists. You can tell one or more user stories if they are inter-related.''
''Please list requirements per user story.''
''It would be useful to explain where the use of the distributed ledger begins. For example, in a use case for prescription drugs, it would be valuable to ensure: * The manufacturer has sourced the correct ingredients * The manufacturer has combined the ingredients correctly * The manufacturer has tested the finished product and recorded the results for later audit * The finished goods are tracked to ensure the end user received exactly what the manufacturer shipped However, these could all be different use cases addressed with different solutions. So, it's important to explain where the problem starts and where distributed ledger technology would help.''

==== Section 3 - Requirements Not Related to User Stories ====

''It is useful to specify requirements that should be considered but may not be apparent through the user story and usage examples.  This information will help the developers be aware of any additional known constraints that need to be met for adoption of the newly implemented features/functionality.  Precise specifications of the requirements make a developer's job much easier, so when in doubt, consult a technical expert.''
''Example of the requirements not obvious thru user stories: performance, hardware, connectivity, privacy etc.''

==== Section 4 -   External References and Glossary ====

''Please use this section to add references for standards or well-defined mechanisms.   In particular, if any of your requirements specifically call for the implementation of a standard or protocol or other well-defined mechanism, use this section to list them. ''
''Additionally, if your use case needs non-standard consensus mechanisms or cryptographic tools, please include technical material here, or references to technical material (i.e. a link to an eprint paper with security proofs).  Remember, the burden of proof for security or consensus of non-standard mechanisms will be placed upon the proposer rather than the evaluator of the proposal, so be verbose here if necessary.''
''It is highly suggested that you define any terms, abbreviations that are not commonly used in order to ensure that your user story is understood properly.''

''Provide a list of acronyms, their expansions, and what they actually mean in general language here. Define any terms that are specific to your problem domain. If there are devices, appliances, or software stacks that you expect to
interact with Hyperledger, list them here.''
