==== Pre-wiki document history ====

^ Document Versioning |  |  |  |
|   ^ Author ^ Date ^ Description ^
|   | Jeremy Sevareid | Sep 21 2016 | Use Case Inventory - Added DvP use case link |
|   | Jeremy Sevareid | Aug 04 2016 | Created spreadsheet from wiki page and migrated some sections as versions below. https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger/wiki/Reformatted-Use-Case-Dashboard |
|   | Jeremy Sevareid | May 24 2016 | This is a refactoring of the inventory of use cases, their statuses, and active editors as of Wednesday 25-May-2016. This is suggested as an alternative format for the dashboard, but keeping the content the same: |
|   |  |  |  |
|   |  |  | Drop-in update for the current Use Case Development Dashboard |
|   |  |  | Replacement for use-cases listing sections of the Requirements Working Group main page |
|   |  |  | Retirement of following pages already proposed for deprecation |
|   |  |  | Use Cases Index |
|   |  |  | Identity WG Use Cases Inventory |
|   | Jeremy Sevareid | May 24 2016 | Status Definitions |
|   |  |  | For the use cases above, the status represents the degree of completion as gauged against the use case template: |
|   |  |  |  |
|   |  |  | TBD, or Placeholder |
|   |  |  | Empty, please add some information to get us started |
|   |  |  | Ideas to develop into use cases |
|   |  |  | Raw, or Free-form Text |
|   |  |  | Free text notes on a use-case - does not follow the [use-case template Use-Case-Template) |
|   |  |  | The [template Use-Case-Template) not yet applied. |
|   |  |  | In development |
|   |  |  | Use-cases have moved to the template, but no sections are completed |
|   |  |  | Use cases follow the [template Use-Case-Template) with the Intro, user stories, States and Transitions being developed. |
|   |  |  | Milestone 1 |
|   |  |  | Section 1 (Intro) and Section 2 (States and Transitions) of the template are complete |
|   |  |  | Section 1 'Intro' and Section 2 'States and Transitions' are complete |
|   |  |  | Milestone 2 |
|   |  |  | Sections 1, 2, and 3 (Requirements) of template are complete |
|   |  |  | Sections 1, 2 and 3 'Requirements' are complete |
|   | Jeremy Sevareid | May 25 2016 | As of 2016-May-26, the status of this current list is: |
|   |  |  | DRAFT and in no way final, complete nor sufficient |
|   |  |  | Not-yet-reconciled with the use case pages within this wiki |
|   |  |  | Not-yet-rationalized down to core use cases |
|   |  |  | Not-yet-peer-reviewed |
|   |  |  |  |
|   |  |  | References |
|   |  |  | Some of the use cases are expected to be relevant to identity management for Hyperledger. The deprecated page that some of them came from is https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger/wiki/Identity-WG---Use-Cases-Inventory/_edit<br/>That was based, in turn, on notes from the Identity WG meeting held at the DTCC in the NYC area on May 5th, 2016. |
|   |  |  |  |
|   |  |  | Some of the use cases draw upon the Beyond Bitcoin graphic accompanying the Bloomberg article, "Blythe Masters Tells Banks the Blockchain Changes Everything." http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-09-01/blythe-masters-tells-banks-the-blockchain-changes-everything |
