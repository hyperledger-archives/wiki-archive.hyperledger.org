===== Project Health =====
Hyperledger Indy has maintained its substantial growth during these summer months. The Indy project has made significant progress toward graduating incubation status, having completed 94% of CII badge requirements. Indy’s codebase has surpassed 10,000 commits from over 100 contributors, and continues to look forward to general availability.

As a part of the progress in indy-sdk and indy-node, Indy’s Q2-2018 was highlighted by significant contributions to Indy Agents—key components to the Indy use-cases. Global developer interest and contribution has also continued; notably, the [[projects:indy:june_2018_amsterdam_hackathon|Amsterdam Hackathon]] (June) and Indy Agent Workshop (July) both garnered international representation.

Additional organizations are making ongoing contributions. This is shown by the shared [[projects:indy:roadmap|Running Roadmap]] for Hyperledger Indy.


===== Issues =====
The rapid growth of the Indy project has resulted in a lack of consistency in some areas. We are currently addressing the following specific concerns:
====Meet the needs of a diverse set of contributors====
  * Coordination between teams has been difficult at times, slowing progress in some aspects of development
//Remediation://
  * Keeping the shared [[projects:indy:roadmap|roadmap]] up-to-date
  * Establishing procedures for multiple teams to hold independent sprints in the Indy project of Hyperledger Jira
  * Embedding developers from multiple organizations into the same sprint team to meet specific development goals
  * A coordinated effort to establish project standards through [[https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe|Hyperledger Indy Project Enhancement]] (HIPE) documents
  * Holding coordination calls between maintainers from different organizations (every other Monday)
====Ensure quality releases for downstream users====
//Remediation://
  * Significant focus on testing Indy Node for scalability and performance, resulting in a lot of bug fixes and refactoring for maintainability
  * Identified places where the algorithms for view change and catch-up can fail, and scheduled an effort for improving those algorithms
  * Creating new tools for automated testing (indy-chaos framework)
====Inconsistent documentation====
  * The lack of quality documentation remains a significant obstacle for many of those interested in working with Indy
  * Many contributors have included documentation with their work; however, this documentation sometimes does not match the existing documentation or is not easily found
//Remediation://
  * Established an indy-outreach chat channel to coordinate efforts
  * Established a HIPE to establish documentation guidelines
  * Consolidating redundant documentation and reworking it for different user levels
  * Proof-of-concept implementation for publishing documentation to a shared site (Read The Docs)
====Minimize the onboarding burden for both developers and users====
  * The learning curve for new developers is currently very steep
//Remediation://
  * Adding a higher level API for credential exchange to the Indy SDK
  * Providing agents that can be used as starting points for solution developers
====Incompatible agent implementations====
  * The early adopters who have focused on getting Indy solutions into production have made different development choices regarding agent communication
//Remediation://
  * These agents have been contributed to a common repository where we can create a set of intercompatible reference agents
  * Brigham Young University hosted an Agent Workshop where the organizations with active agent implementations could meet to discuss design differences and progress to a common protocol
  * Establishing a canonical test suite to verify that a new agent follows the established communication protocol
====Measuring the size and make-up of our user community====
  * We don’t currently have good data on the usage of Indy by organizations deploying Indy networks or by developers creating solutions
//Remediation://
  * Working with Hyperledger to get analytics about GitHub project usage, web sites, Rocket Chat usage
  * Begin measuring usage of the Sovrin forums: new contributors, questions asked, and questions answered

===== Maintainer Diversity =====
Indy maintainers remain active in developing and contributing to working group calls and public discussions. The bi-weekly Indy Maintainers Circle call has consistently been the medium by which maintainers coordinate work, discuss critical issues to the Indy codebase, and resolve HIPEs. The Indy maintainers list has grown to include new Indy Agent contributors. With the addition of two Indy Agent maintainers, we have incorporated new organizations and interest into the maintainers circle. We now also hold regular calls for Indy SDK contributors and Indy Agent contributors to remain aligned on their respective code bases.


===== Contributor Diversity =====
Hyperledger Indy continues to see contribution from developers and organizations around the world. Well over 1000 commits were merged into the Indy project from dozens of different contributors over the past three months. The progress in Indy Agent has also aided developers in building applications on top of Indy, which has in turn led to more contribution to the project. The [[projects:indy:roadmap|Indy Community Roadmap]] provides updates on different teams that are working with Indy (currently includes Evernym, BYU OIT, BC.gov, WIPRO, and SecureKey).

====POCs, Pilots, Projects====
