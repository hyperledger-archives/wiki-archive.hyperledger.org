  - v0.8.0: 2018-03-31 (planed)   

===== Overall Activity in the Past Quarter =====

  * Conversation mostly happen on the [[https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello|rocketchat channel]], emails were answered as well.
  * When people asking Hyperledger deployment method or questions from outside of the community,response emails often point people to the [[https://github.com/hyperledger/cello|cello project readme]] docs and rocket channel.
  * The community is working hard to provide a solution so that people can adopt and experience hyperledger techniques easily, we already integrated the [[https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer|blockchain-explorer]] project, and now are actively integrating [[https://github.com/hyperledger/composer|fabric composer]] into the project. Once this feature is complete, users will be able to stand up fabric network and start developing their business network using composer.
  * Cello currently has 3 [[https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md|maintainers]] who are actively working on the project and contributing.
  * Cello maintainers also take turns updating the cello wiki pages and required document like this.

===== Current Plans =====

  * Ensure the release of 0.8.0
  * Integrate fabric composer to the created fabric network
  * Create more mini-series of how-to videos
  * Update documents so that users can get started quickly


===== Maintainer Diversity =====

There are 3 maintainers from IBM (2) and Oracle (1), covering both North America and Asia Pacific.

We nominate new maintainers based on continuous contributions in terms of code, QA/education, doc and review activities.


===== Contributor Diversity =====

Current number of project contributors is 25 with 62 patch sets merged since last December. With project gets more attention, this number will certainly increase.  

===== Additional Information =====

Cello developers have been participating in local meetups and global hackfest events to promote and demo the project, and help attract more people to join and use hyperledger products.
