====== Hyperledger Project Update ======

===== Project =====
Hyperledger Quilt

===== Project Health =====
Quilt has had slow steady progress toward a v1 release of the Java ILP SDK. One additional contributor is providing detailed reviews and two new community members have expressed an interest in becoming contributors going forward.


===== Issues =====
Nothing new. We continue to struggle with resourcing but are making slow progress none-the-less.


===== Releases =====
No code releases but significant work on issue triage completed and numerous bugs fixed and minor feature additions to the existing codebase.


===== Overall Activity in the Past Quarter =====
Bi-weekly calls have had very few dial-ins however the core contributors still meet regularly and use the calls to triage the issue list and discuss architectural issues.


===== Current Plans =====
Goal remains to have a v1 release of the following ILP components:
 - ILP core (packets, codecs etc. Mostly done)
 - ILDCP protocol (mostly done)
 - BTP protocol (codecs complete, integration with WebSockets to do)
 - STREAM protocol (not started)

Stretch Goal: There is work being done on an implementation of a full ILP connector. This is not part of the roadmap as it is not a high priority however the person responsible is personally interested in completing the work.

===== Maintainer Diversity =====
No changes


===== Contributor Diversity =====
A new contributor (Nick Dudfield) has been providing valuable code reviews
Wanchain are interested in becoming more involved and will join the next community call (26 September).


===== Additional Information =====
There is an implementation of the ILP protocol stack being done in Go. We are discussing the possibility of including this into the Quilt project with the maintainer: https://github.com/interledger/go-ilp
