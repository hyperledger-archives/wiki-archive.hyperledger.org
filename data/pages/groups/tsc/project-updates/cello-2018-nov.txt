  * Plan to make the release of 1.0.0 for next quarter.


===== Maintainer Diversity =====
There are 4 maintainers from IBM (2) and Oracle (1) and VMware(1), covering both North America and Asia Pacific.
We nominate new maintainers based on continuous contributions in terms of code, QA/education, doc and review activities.

===== Contributor Diversity =====

Code contributors are stable now and we found more and more users come into the community asking questions and using cello for their products.

Two new companies appear as H3C and Yongyou.

===== Additional Information =====
Cello developers have been participating in meetups and hackfest events to promote and demo the project, and help attract more people to join and use hyperledger products. 

Would seek more opportunities to collaborate more with other projects and communities.
