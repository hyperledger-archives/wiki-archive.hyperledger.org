====== Hyperledger Working Group Update ======

===== Training & Education Working Group =====


===== Working Group Health =====
Meetings continue to hover around 18. Product creation is slow. Participants in China requested an earlier meeting time, we switched for several months from 10:00 PST to 8:00 PST. A few key contributors cannot attend at 8:00 and the participants who requested the change have not attended for months. As such, with the daylight savings time change (in some countries), starting 5 November we will roll back to the 10:00 PST meeting time.

We are considering a group name change to more clearly address the charter of the group. As participants complete the edX course(s) they see Training & Education as next steps in their learning. A majority of our participants attend as a place where they hope to receive Training & Education rather than where they plan to develop Training & Education. One idea is a name change to **Learning Materials Development WG**

===== Issues =====
We will select a new co-lead as working group administrator. I will lead a subgroup project, Smart Contracts with 2-3 T&E participants. I will attend meetings and be available as a substitute.

===== Overall Activity in the Past Quarter =====
Mailing lists go out with an agenda before each meeting and no meetings have been missed.
