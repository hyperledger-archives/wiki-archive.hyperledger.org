    - We now hold monthly meetups in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou (Dalian and Wuhan not regularly), supported by our volunteers.
    - Have drafted and formalized a event organization guideilne, which will be followed by event organization.


=== Issues ===
  - We are holding regular monthly meetup in various cities, need funding support for meeting places and small gifts. And need to enhance the marketing impact.
  - In order to organize the translated documentation, training materials, tutorial videos, can we have some Chinese version of website? e.g., hyperledger.cn? just like those in kubernetes/openstack communities.
