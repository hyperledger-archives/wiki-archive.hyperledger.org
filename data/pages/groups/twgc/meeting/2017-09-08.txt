==== Agenda ====
  - Zanata Q&A


==== Minutes ====
Alex Eng from RedHat is very generous to offer a Q&A session to answer questions we had for Zanata

Q: Integration with Github: the tool should be able to pull source docs from Hyperledger repo, and push translated docs to CN Repo.

A: We could use [[https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Zanata+Plugin | zanata jenkins plugin]] to accomplish this 

Q: Format of docs: currently docs are in rst format. Ideally the tool should be able to convert to/from it

A: We need to convert between rst/html in jenkins

Q: Review support: the tool should support role-based operation, reviewer/translator

A: Yes it does.

Q: Service infrastructure: Official web service or self-host service

A: zanata.org is free of use, but a bit old in terms of version. We could use this at beginning, but consider setting up our own instance later on

**TODO**: Linsheng and Jiannan will investigate Zanata Jenkins Plugin.
