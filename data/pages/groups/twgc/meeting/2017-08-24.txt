==== Agenda ====
  - Translation Tool Discussion


==== Minutes ====
  - In general, using a translation tool like [[zanata.org|Zanata]]/[[transifex.com|Transifex]] is more appropriate for this task than using Github/Gerrit, however, learning curve of such tools is intimidating, especially for new contributors.
  - Zanata is more user-friendly and opens source friendly than Tansifex.
  - We need to consider following aspects while evaluating the tool:
    - Integration with Github: the tool should be able to pull source docs from Hyperledger repo, and push translated docs to CN Repo
    - Format of docs: currently docs are in rst format. Ideally the tool should be able to convert to/from it
    - Review support: the tool should support role-based operation, reviewer/translator
    - Service infrastructure: Official web service or self-host service
  - **TODO**: Linsheng and Jiannan will develop an end-to-end demo to showcase the work flow of Zanata and propose to next TWGC meeting
