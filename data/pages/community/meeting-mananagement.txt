====== Managing Zoom Meetings ======

This information is for meeting owners.

In order to keep meeting recording sizes appropriate, and to ensure timely posting of meeting recordings, here are the steps a meeting owner should take.

  * Before the meeting starts, use the owner code to take ownership of the meeting.
  * When the meeting starts, stop any ongoing recording and start a new recording (choosing to record locally).
  * When the meeting ends, end the meeting for all participants (only end the meeting if participants from the next meeting have not joined; otherwise, stop the recording).
  * Upload your local recording to the provided Google Drive

If you are a meeting owner and do not have the owner code, please email community-architects@hyperledger.org.
