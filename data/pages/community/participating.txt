====== Participating in the Community ======

All Hyperledger working groups (specs) and projects (code) do their work in the open, with the code and discussions published publicly.

  * All code is forkable from [[https://github.com/hyperledger/|GitHub]].

  * Committers use [[https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/admin/projects/|Gerrit]] or [[https://github.com/hyperledger | GitHub]] to submit and accept changes.

  * Bugs in current code should be [[community:jira-navigation | submitted to JIRA]].

  * Projects use [[http://lists.hyperledger.org/| mailing lists]] for all technical discussions and announcements; you are free to join.

  * Many working groups hold [[community:calendar-public-meetings | regular public meetings]] where anyone can participate.

  * Live discussions happen in [[community:chat_channels | RocketChat channels]] (//instead of Slack//).

  * Projects at Hyperledger have a [[community:project-lifecycle | lifecycle from incubation to production]] products.

  * We encourage everyone to [[community:meetups | attend or start Meetups]] about Hyperledger projects.

  * Please follow the [[community:hyperledger-project-code-of-conduct | Code of Conduct]] when interacting in Hyperledger communities.
