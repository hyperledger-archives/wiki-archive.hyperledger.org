**For Mentors: Tips for Effective and Successful Mentorship**
  * **Communicate**: Communicate with your intern often, whether it is to provide feedback, offer training, or check on the intern’s progress. By keeping the line of communication open you will build trust, respect, and a positive relationship that facilitates the successful completion of the project.
  * **Mentor**: Schedule a regular review meeting with your intern. Mentorship is a critical and essential part of an internship experience, and an attribute that differentiates from regular employment. As a mentor, it’s important to give your intern honest feedback on professionalism and career preparedness.
  * **Connect**: To foster learning outside of your intern’s job duties, encourage your intern to develop relationships outside or his or her immediate team. Allowing your intern to gain a broader understanding of your organization, industry, and potential career paths can help generate new ideas and make him or her a more effective contributing member.
  * **Revisit**: Periodically revisit the learning objectives and expected outcomes established at the beginning of the internship. Discuss what the student has learned and how it can be applied in the future. Be flexible to adjust the project scope, learning objectives, and outcomes based on the intern's background and skill set.
