===== Status =====

This project is in [[community:project-lifecycle#incubation|Incubation]]


===== Description =====


Hyperledger Indy provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers so that they are interoperable across administrative domains, applications, and any other silo.


Indy is in active development across:

Distributed Ledger:
  * [[https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node | indy-node]]
  * [[https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum | indy-plenum ]]

Client Tools:
  * [[https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk | indy-sdk ]]
  * [[https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent | indy-agent ]]

Shared Components:
  * [[https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe | indy-hipe ]]
  * [[https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-crypto | indy-crypto ]] 


===== Key Characteristics =====

  * Distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity
  * Correlation-resistant by design
  * DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) that are globally unique and resolvable (via a ledger) without requiring any centralized resolution authority
  * Pairwise Identifiers create secure, 1:1 relationships between any two entities
  * Verifiable Claims are interoperable format for exchange of digital identity attributes and relationships currently in the standardization pipeline at the W3C
  * Zero Knowledge Proofs which prove that some or all of the data in a set of Claims is true without revealing any additional information, including the identity of the Prover


===== Documentation =====

An index of Indy documentation can be [[projects:indy:documentation | found here]]. 

The documentation of the nitty gritty of the underpinnings of the code is located in the "docs" folder of each repo. 

**Note:** Indy Documentation is in the process of migrating to:[[https://indy.readthedocs.io/|indy.readthedocs.io]]
