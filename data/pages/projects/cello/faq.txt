==== What does Cello do?====
Cello is towards the operation system for blockchain networks. It will help user startup, operate and manage the distributed ledgers through dashboards. Using cello, it is always easy to create a blockchain service platform, e.g., BaaS.

==== Is it possible to manage blockchains across multiple hosts using cello?====

Yes, currently, cello supports multiple kinds of agents to utilize various infrastructures.

E.g., with the ansible agent, it's easy to allow cello to manage blockchain networks on multi-servers/vms.

Besides, we are designing the k8s agent now to enable cello employing kubernetes cluster better to host blockchain networks.


==== How to find the service log in Cello ====

Run `make log` in the master node.

==== Healthy check failed of cluster while deploying CELLO on AWS ====

Make sure the relative ports are not baned by the  security group.

==== Worker node setup failed caused by nfs mount error ====

Please check the worker node setup output, if has error like this:

       mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on 192.168.1.49:
           missing codepage or helper program, or other error
           (for several filesystems (e.g. nfs, cifs) you might
           need a /sbin/mount.<type> helper program)
           In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
           dmesg | tail or so.
 
this mean you missing nfs-common packge, run command "apt-get install nfs-common" to install it, and then setup worker node again.

==== Can not login in localhost:8080 or localhost:8081 ====

With using docker-17.03.0 may cause this problem, Try to use the newer version like docker-17.06.0.

==== I still cannot resolve my problem ====

Clean you environment and try to re-clone the latest code.

If still not work, then feel free to open a jira issue to include:

  - Code Version;
  - OS type and docker/k8s version;
  - Logs of the cello services;
  - Steps to repeat the issue.

Then post the jira link to [[https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello| rocket channel]].
