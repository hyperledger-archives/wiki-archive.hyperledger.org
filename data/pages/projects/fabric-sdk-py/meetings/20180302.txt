Discuss the chain code instantiate error.

When to deploy the chain code, the return value
is good. but the chain code is not up really.
After some investigation, the connection between
peer and chain code container is off when to bootstrap
the chain code.

And the cause may be the default policy which now is null
string. But reference to the gohfc code, the default policy
should be built.
