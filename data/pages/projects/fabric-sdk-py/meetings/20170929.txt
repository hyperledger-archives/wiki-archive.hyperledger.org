baohua 11:02 AM

@hanhzf how about https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/q/project:fabric-sdk-py+AND+status:open

grapebaba 11:03 AM

hanhzf 11:03 AM

baohua 11:04 AM

hanhzf 11:04 AM
yes, login

baohua 11:04 AM
@ry do we required login-in users to view open gerrit issues?
this one? https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/q/project:fabric-sdk-py+AND+status:open

tonyyang132 11:05 AM
this one works

baohua 11:05 AM
aha, gerrit has two UIs, which have different URL...
OK, after we finish the installation operation, we can go forward to the instantiate one? @grapebaba

hanhzf 11:06 AM
yeah, this one works

baohua 11:06 AM
There are some task opened, anyone pls feel free to pick https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4623?jql=project%20%3D%20FAB%20AND%20status%20in%20(%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20%22To%20Do%22)%20AND%20component%20%3D%20fabric-sdk-py
we need to implement: instantiate, invoke chaincode
after that, the MVP is done! we can enhance the channel operations later
so, any volunteer for those items?
i guess those can be implemented simultaneously
@tonyyang132 how's going with ur side?

tonyyang132 11:10 AM
just finished a busy sprint...

baohua 11:10 AM
nice to hear that, would u like to pick some interesting one like the cc invoke operation?
i guess there're already some codes to be done.

hanhzf 11:11 AM
Yes, we can pick up the invoke work

baohua 11:11 AM
thanks, zhaofang
then i will assign this one https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5491?jql=project%20%3D%20FAB%20AND%20status%20in%20(%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20%22To%20Do%22)%20AND%20component%20%3D%20fabric-sdk-py to u
basically, u can create an env by peer cli cmds

hanhzf 11:12 AM
Will start travel from tmr, start working on it after national holiday, will that be ok ?

baohua 11:12 AM
sure, we will let everyone enjoy the holiday, and cancel next week meeting.
üôÇ

hanhzf 11:13 AM
Yup, no problem, will keep on updating

baohua 11:13 AM
OK, and the instantiate operation, would u like to pick? @tonyyang132
this one: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5489
kai already finish the install steps, i guess it's similar process code

tonyyang132 11:15 AM
OK, I guess I could take that

baohua 11:15 AM
thanks, assign to u

hanhzf 11:15 AM

@bryanhuang thanks a lot!

bryanhuang 11:21 AM
but its depends on the instantiate operation, I will start the work once instantiation done.

baohua 11:22 AM
@bryanhuang seems we do not have that task yet? pls help create a jira task about it and assign to urself.
yeap, upgrade is similar with instantiate, so pls collaborate closely with each other.

tonyyang132 11:23 AM
so https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5489 is about install and instantiate, did you mean the installation part is done? @baohua

baohua 11:23 AM
aha, maybe we can split that into two separate ones.

bryanhuang 11:23 AM
right

baohua 11:23 AM
@toddinpal yes, we will merge today after more reviews
@tonyyang132 u can split the tasks too
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/q/project:fabric-sdk-py+AND+status:open
Ok, again, everyone pls help review those patchsets, and add ur comments.
Thanks üê•

tonyyang132 11:24 AM

baohua 11:25 AM
yes, installation
Ok, seems very good and efficient today. Anything else? @grapebaba
and everyone else?

tonyyang132 11:26 AM
so after I split FAB-5489, can I assign the install part to Chen Kai since he's finished coding?

grapebaba 11:27 AM
that task is for E2E test
please check the parent task

baohua 11:27 AM
since kai is using the task number in the patchset, it's better u create one for instantiate separately?
and modify the original task to install only.
make sense? @grapebaba

grapebaba 11:27 AM
no
i don't use this task
this task is for E2E test created by @wangdong

baohua 11:28 AM
aha, FAB-5151

@tonyyang132 you can create a new task for instaniate

baohua 11:28 AM
@tonyyang132 just help keep the task number in gerrit is the same with those at jira.
Thanks

tonyyang132 11:29 AM
OK

baohua 11:29 AM
OK, anything else?
@grapebaba

grapebaba 11:30 AM
no for me

baohua 11:30 AM
OK, cool
If nothing else, we will end the meeting.
