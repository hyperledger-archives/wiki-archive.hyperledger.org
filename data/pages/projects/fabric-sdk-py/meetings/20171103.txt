Today's agenda: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric-sdk-py/meetings/20171103
OK
seems no more else, let's do some quick sync
recently i found an interesting gosdk project: https://github.com/CognitionFoundry/gohfc
people use it to give some perf evaluate result (non-official)
i guess we can have a look at it too, which is really simple in design.
thoughts? @grapebaba

grapebaba 11:01 AM
well
what is the main difference with official go-sdk?

baohua 11:02 AM
not too much, the key advantage is that it's simple and basic
donot know whether they will contribute to community

grapebaba 11:04 AM
good, will see

baohua 11:04 AM
And besides chaincode installation, do u know how's going on @tonyyang132 's work on chaincode instantiate?

grapebaba 11:04 AM
indeed all SDKs currently more complex

baohua 11:04 AM
@hanhzf is working on chaincode invoke
