==log==

Today's meeting is in zoom. 
we got two new members: Manoel and Jianlong Cui.

The main topic is:

1. chat with new members and welcome them to join in.

2. bug of install chaincode.
   When to install chaincode, it actually does nothing, but
   return the right code. This is a weird one which blocks
   the test of chaincode deploy. It seems it is the chaincode
   packaging method which fails to fetch the code and return none.
   We will verify this and debug it.
   
3. Manoel will is good at pyhont and interested in Fabric Ca.
   He already has a commit about ca. He will keep his interest then.
