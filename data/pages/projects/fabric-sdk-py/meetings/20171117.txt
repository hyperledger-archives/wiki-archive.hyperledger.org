sry - 4882
hope i can create the pr soon

baohua 11:03 AM
thanks, david, hope u will get more time in following weeks
holidays are coming, haha

ðŸ™‚

baohua 11:04 AM
any travel plan?

david_dornseifer 11:04 AM
should we upgrade the testing images to 1.0.4?

baohua 11:05 AM
do u think it's necessary?
1.1-preview is released

david_dornseifer 11:06 AM
have not looked into that - many changes in the protos? / can test both with our current codebase and see if it works

baohua 11:06 AM
not too much change
IMHO, it's nice-to-have, but won't need to spend too much effort, certainly

david_dornseifer 11:07 AM
yea think so too

baohua 11:07 AM
those channel/chaincode operations are waiting for us eagerly
great!

david_dornseifer 11:08 AM
invoke and query would be nice to have ðŸ™‚

baohua 11:08 AM
any technical issue to discuss? i plan to refine the existing code architecture, which is way more complicated than expected. but maybe can wait for time till we have chaincode invocation and channel join
@wangdong said he will finish the chaincode invocation soon
really hard-working guy

david_dornseifer 11:10 AM
ok - agree we should wait with refactoring until the basic functions are there

baohua 11:10 AM
yes, but let's go on with those minor fixes
ok, nothing too much from my side, just attend the membership summit, which attracts lots of eyeballs by fabric
there will be lots of potential adoptions of our sdk
anything else for u? @david_dornseifer

david_dornseifer 11:12 AM
second you opinion about the adoption
and with 1.1 fabric will be much more attractive

baohua 11:13 AM
yes, the privacy protection
we hope to finish the 1.0 sdk before fabric 1.1 release

david_dornseifer 11:13 AM
would be nice

baohua 11:14 AM
exactly
ok, if nothing else, will end the meeting
have nice thanksgiving days, david!

david_dornseifer 11:15 AM
@baohua thanks alot
bye
