baohua [11:06 AM]  
Welcome every developer~~ let’s work together on the project!

[11:06]  
2. New joiner get familiar with community tools: jira, gerrit, slack

[11:06]  
Mainly, jira is for task assignment. Everyone can create new task item there.

[11:07]  
New created item is with “todo” status, and other people can assign it to himself.

[11:07]  
After assignment, he should update the task to “in-processing” status, and give an estimated time.

[11:07]  
Jira is here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=85

[11:08]  
We use gerrit for code repo: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org. On the README.md there is steps on how to use it.

[11:08]  
Slack channel is where we discuss, i guess there is some robot support.

[11:09]  
any question?

[11:10]  
3. baohua and kai will lead the log module design.

[11:10]

https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/q/status:open+project:fabric-sdk-py

[11:14]

bryan-huang [11:14 AM]  
:raised_hand:

grapebaba [11:14 AM]  
yes, CI task should high priority

gengjh [11:14 AM]  
i think everyone can give review comments and +1/-1 in gerrit

baohua [11:14 AM]  
@hanhzf

[11:15]  
Yes, we encourage everyone

gengjh [11:15 AM]  
so you mean +2/-2 for need more volunteer to review ?

baohua [11:15 AM]  
no, just as normal review

gengjh [11:16 AM]  
ok

baohua [11:16 AM]  
cool, and the next item is the SDK spec

[11:16]  
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R5RtIBMW9fZpli37E5Li5_Q9ve3BnQ4q3gWmGZj6Sv4

[11:16]  
Please go to this link and help review

lafenicecc [11:17 AM]  
will this spec be the guide of all the sdk

[11:17]  
all the sdk projects?

baohua [11:17 AM]  
yes

lafenicecc [11:17 AM]  
not limited to py

grapebaba [11:17 AM]  
i think this spec could add crypto module

baohua [11:17 AM]  
It’s a abstracted design guideline for all SDKs.

[11:17]  
@grapebaba sure, feel free to add your comments or suggestions there.

[11:18]  
Now it’s still in development

lafenicecc [11:18 AM]  
so we basically follow the APIs listed there?

baohua [11:18 AM]  
That would be good to follow, it’s recommended. And the SDK spec discuss meeting is this evening. Welcome for joining.

[11:18]  
Weekly, WebEx common fabric SDK focus meeting
Friday, October 14, 2016
7:00 am  |  Eastern Daylight Time (New York, GMT-04:00)  |  1 hr
Meeting number: 255 534 655
Meeting password: 159577

[11:19]  
OK, is there any other item to discuss by anyone?

[11:21]  
any more items to discuss by any one?

gengjh [11:21 AM]  
i think there are still a lot of todo items should be created in jira. do we have any plan to init those backlog?

baohua [11:21 AM]  
@gengjh Sure, just feel free to discuss with the team and create the task at JIra

[11:22]  
Our team’s style is  self-motivated :slightly_smiling_face:

bryan-huang [11:22 AM]  
I don’t like the code structure of js sdk (hfc), put everything in one js file, so I think we can make it better

[11:22]  
in the py sdk

baohua [11:23 AM]  
sure :slightly_smiling_face: as the js sdk was started even before the spec.

[11:23]  
any more items?

[11:24]  
OK. Then in summary we now have two assignment, 1) please help review the patchset and 2) the SDK Spec. And always feel free to propose your idea with the team. Thanks and have a good day!
