======Hyperledger Indy Glossary======

Note: “Ledger” refers to a ledger using Hyperledger Indy as the codebase


====A====

**Agency.** A service provider that hosts Cloud Agents and may provision Edge Agents on behalf of a Ledger’s Entities. 
[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

**Agent.** A software program or process used by or acting on behalf of a Ledger’s Entity to interact with other Agents or, via a Ledger’s Client component, directly with the Ledger. Agents are of two types: Edge Agents run at the edge of the network on a local device, while Cloud Agents run remotely on a server or cloud hosting service. Agents typically have access to a Wallet in order to perform cryptographic operations on behalf of the Ledger’s Entity they represent.

**Anonym.** A Blinded Identifier used exactly once. See also Pseudonym and Verinym.
[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

====B====

**Blinded Identifier.** A DID authorized to be written to the Ledger using a Zero-Knowledge Proof in order to blind the Legal Identity of the Identity Owner. Blinded Identifiers include Anonyms and Pseudonyms. Mutually exclusive with Verinym.
[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

====C====

**Claim.** A digital assertion about identity attributes made by a Ledger Entity about itself or another Ledger Entity. The entity making the Claim is called the Issuer. The entity holding the issued Claim is called the Holder. If the Claim supports Zero Knowledge Proofs, the Holder is also called the Prover. The entity to whom a Claim is presented is called the Relying Party. A Claim may be Public Data or Private Data. Once issued, a Claim is typically stored by an Agent.
[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

**Claim Definition.** A machine-readable definition of the semantic structure of a Claim. Claim Definitions facilitate interoperability of Claims and Proofs across multiple Issuers, Holders, and Relying Parties. In the future this may extend to interoperability with other trust frameworks.
[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

**Claim Offer.** An invitation from an Issuer to a Holder to send a Claim Request to the Issuer.
[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

**Claim Request.** A request to an Issuer to issue a Claim to a Holder.
[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

**Cloud Agent.** An Agent that does not run at the edge of the network on a local device with which an Identity Owner interacts directly, but remotely on a server or cloud hosting service. Mutually exclusive with Edge Agent. A Cloud Agent typically has a Service Endpoint and may have access to a Cloud Wallet. Cloud agents may be hosted by an Agency. 
[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

**Cloud Wallet.** A Wallet that operates remotely on a server or cloud hosting service and stores its cryptographic key material securely on that server or cloud service. Cloud Wallets will typically use an HSM (Hardware Security Module). Mutually exclusive with Edge Wallet.
[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

**Connection.** A digital relationship established between two Ledger Entities via their selected Identities to exchange Public Data or Private Data, such as Verifiable Claims, between their Agents. A Connection may or may not be published as a Claim. A Connection itself may be either Public Data or Private Data and may be formed using either a Verinym or a Pseudonym.
[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

**Connection Offer.** An invitation from a one Ledger Entity to a second Ledger Entity to send the first Entity a Connection Request. Connection Offers are needed only in specialized use cases; in most cases a Connection will start with a Connection Request.

[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

====E====

**Edge Agent.** An Agent that runs at the edge of the network on a local device, such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop, automotive computer, etc. Mutually exclusive with Cloud Agent. An Edge Agent may be an app used directly by an Identity Owner, or it may be an operating system module or background process called by other apps. Edge Agents typically do not have a Service Endpoint, but do have access to a Edge Wallet.
[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

**Edge Wallet.** A Wallet, typically used by a Edge Agent, that operates at the edge of the network on a local device and stores its cryptographic key material in a secure enclave or other secure storage on that device. Mutually exclusive with Cloud Wallet.

[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

====I====

**Identity.** A set of Identity Records, Claims, and Proofs that describes a Ledger Entity. To protect privacy: a) an Identity Owner may have more than one Ledger Identity, and b) only the Identity Owner and the Relying Party(s) with whom an Identity is shared knows the specific set of Identity Records, Claims, and Proofs that comprise that particular Identity.

[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

**Independent.** An Individual who directly controls the Private Key(s) and Master Secret(s) necessary to administer an Identity and thus is not dependent on any other party for control. For any particular Identity, this definition is mutually exclusive with Dependent. Note that it is possible (though not a best practice) for the same Identity Owner to be both an Independent for some Identities and a Dependent on others.
[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

====J====

**Jurisdiction.** A legally defined scope of authority to which an Identity Owner is bound at any one point in time. Jurisdiction is relevant to some Trust Framework policies to help ensure geographic diversity among Stewards and Trust Anchors. For these purposes, Jurisdiction is defined broadly as: sovereign states or autonomous regions that are members of the United Nations, any UN Specialized Agency, or the Universal Postal Union, as well as sovereign states or autonomous regions that have observer status at the UN or any UN Specialized Agency.
[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

[[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy_glossary|Back to top]]

====M====

**Master Secret.** An item of Private Data used by a Prover to guarantee that a claim uniquely applies to them. The Master Secret is an input to Zero Knowledge Proofs that combine data from multiple Claims in order to prove that the Claims have a common subject (the Prover).
