====== Running Roadmap for Hyperledger Indy ======

===== Introduction =====
This roadmap is to coordinate the various teams contributing to the Hyperledger Indy project. Please read this explanation, and then add your own priorities to this list.

The contributor community for HyperLedger Indy is a diverse group. Each group has their own priorities. By sharing those priorities, we hope to identify areas of shared interest, foster collaboration, and increase the usefulness of delivered items. If something is high on your list, but low on another team’s list, you should seek to have a conversation as you plan your work. Each team roadmap includes a method of contacting a key stakeholder for a discussion.

This roadmap represents each team's high level development priorities, which they will break into Epics and Stories in the referenced issue tracker. Most contributions to Hyperleger Indy will eventually result in an issue being created in the appropriate project of the [[http://jira.hyperledger.org | JIRA instance used by Hyperledger]].

==== Standard Disclaimers ====
The information in this roadmap is shared in good faith, but is exclusively for informational purposes. Nothing on this roadmap shall be considered a commitment by any party to any other party. Priorities, resources, and timeframes will frequently change. Projects may be deferred or cancelled at any stage of development. Delivery of anything on this roadmap remains at the sole discretion of the people doing the work.

Hyperledger Indy is not obligated to accept any contribution, even if it appears on this roadmap. The incorporation of a contribution into the project depends on that contribution meeting established standards and aligning with the development roadmap of the core maintainers.

==== Current Release Plan ====

  * 1.5 (July): Plenum Plugin support, reduced logging in production, stability fixes.
  * 1.6 (August): Connection management and stability fixes.


=== Indy SDK ===
  * Indy SDK 1.6 (July): Wallet search for anoncreds, cluster shared wallet, standardize wallet export format.
