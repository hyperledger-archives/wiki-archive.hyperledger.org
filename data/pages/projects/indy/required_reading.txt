Anoncreds (Indy's implementation of Attribute Based Credentials):
  * This document outlines the various objects used by the system and how they fit together.  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/design/anoncreds.md
  * The diagram here might also be useful https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/relationship-diagram.png
  * Useful paper for terminology and a good framework for Attribute Based Credential systems http://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/idman/idman2013/CamenischDLNPP13.pdf
  * Mike Lodder's walk-through of the protocol: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XEfaOinOTIU9RgtP-GlXQAbOoW8z-oR5aWJDoQdftZ4/edit?usp=sharing
