===== Description =====

Hyperledger Quilt is a Java implementation of the [[https://interledger.org/rfcs/0027-interledger-protocol-4/|Interledger protocol]]. Interledger, also known as ILP, is a protocol for making transactions across ledgers. The protocol’s standards and specifications are being defined by the [[https://www.w3.org/community/interledger/|open source community under the World Wide Web Consortium umbrella]].

Hyperledger Quilt offers interoperability between ledger systems by implementing ILP, which is primarily a payments protocol and is designed to transfer value across systems – both distributed ledgers and non-distributed ledgers. It is a simple protocol that establishes a global namespace for accounts, as well as, a protocol for synchronized atomic swaps between different systems.

====== Key Characteristics ======

By implementing the Interledger protocol, Quilt provides:

  * A set of rules for enabling ledger interoperability with basic escrow semantics
  * A standard for a ledger-independent address format and data packet format that will enable connectors to route payments
  * A framework for designing higher level use-case-specific protocols
