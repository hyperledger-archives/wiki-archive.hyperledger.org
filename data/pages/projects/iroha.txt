Iroha is a distributed ledger project, that aims to provide a development environment where C++ and mobile application developers to contribute to the Hyperledger Project. The project seeks to complement Fabric, Sawtooth Lake, and other potential projects, by creating reusable components in C++ that can be called from languages such as Go. In this way, Iroha is additive to existing projects and the long term goal is to realize a robust library of reusable components that can be selected and used freely by those running distributed ledgers on Hyperledger technology.

===== Key Characteristics =====

Permissioned network, written in C++, Java chaincode, BFT consensus algorithm YetAnotherConsensus (YAC).
