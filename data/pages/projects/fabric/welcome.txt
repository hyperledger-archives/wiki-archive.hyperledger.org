====== Welcome to Hyperledger Fabric ======

In order to help jump-start your experience with the Hyperledger/Fabric we are giving a this information sheet.

The first question you might have is **what is Hyperledger?** 

Hyperledger is a collaborative effort created to advance blockchain technology by identifying and addressing important features for a cross-industry open standard for distributed ledger technologies(DLTs) that will transform the way business transactions are conducted globally. Hyperledger consists of several projects.

Find out more regarding all the Hyperledger projects [[https://www.hyperledger.org/projects|here]]: 

**What is the specific vision of Hyperledger Fabric?**

We have [[http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/|Information]] and a great [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKa5Gh9whgU&t=4s|Video]] illustrating the vision of Hyperledger Fabric, which was shown at recent events including Sibos 2016.

**Where do I learn more about the design of the Hyperledger Fabric?**

The Fabric is being built in a pluggable modular framework. With this design in mind blockchain
networks can be purpose built with different modules to achieve different goals, such as faster 
ordering service, advanced vs simple query search, etc. Check out the roadmap [[https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/FAB/issues/FAB-37?filter=allopenissues|roadmap]], and our [[projects:fabric:design-docs|Design docs]].

**How do I get started with Hyperledger Fabric?**
 
The [[projects:fabric|Wiki]] is where you will find key items such as:
  * Link to the online [[http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/|documentation]]
  * Link to [[http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html|contributing]]
  * Link to [[https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa|Jira]], which is the place to open a story, epic, task or bug 
  * Link on how to [[http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jira_navigation.html|navigate Jira]] 
  * Link to [[https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/q/status:open|Gerritt]], which is the place to contribute, review CRs or submit code. 
  * [[https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/fabric|Mailing lists]] to subscribe to conversations. 
  * Key [[community:chat_channels|Rocket.chat]] channels to participate and monitor.

**How do I interact with the community?**

Key communication vehicles: 
  * [[https://chat.hyperledger.org/home|Rocket.chat]] for group and 1 on 1 communications.
  * Rocket.chat [[community:chat_channels|channel]] guide, giving descriptions, so you can find what you are most interested in following.
  * [[https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/fabric|Mailing lists]] to subscribe to conversations and participate.
  * "Working groups" - There are several active [[community:calendar-public-meetings|working groups]] that tackle big items such as the technical steering committee, requirements gathering and definition of use cases, identity, and documentation, etc.

**How do I get help?**

  * [[https://chat.hyperledger.org/home|Rocket.chat]] is a great place to start if you have a quick question; just state your question on the channel you have a question. For example, if you have consensus questions open a question on #fabric-consensus.
  * Also search for your answer, or open your question in stack overflow [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hyperledger|Stack overflow]].
  * For longer possible discussion items use the [[https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/fabric|Mailing lists]].

If you have any questions, or wish to have further information please feel free to post in Rocket.chat, or send me a direct message @markparz.
