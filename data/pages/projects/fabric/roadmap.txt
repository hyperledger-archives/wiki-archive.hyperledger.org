==== Hyperledger Fabric Roadmap ====

The roadmap can be viewed on the [[https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10104|Jira project dashboard]].

Discussion for Fabric releases happens [[https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release|on the #fabric-release channel in RocketChat]].

See [[https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric#releases|prior release notes]] for release history and content.  Prior release documentation can be found in the [[https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric#documentation-getting-started-and-developer-guides|documentation links]].

Beginning with the 1.2.0 release, the Fabric maintainers plan on publishing quarterly, focused releases that target a small number of themes for improvements and new features. 

We maintain a [[https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10701|JIRA release dashboard]] for the upcoming release.  The top left gadget on the dashboard indicates which Epics are currently in progress for the upcoming release.
