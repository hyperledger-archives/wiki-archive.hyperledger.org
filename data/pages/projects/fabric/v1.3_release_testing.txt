====== Release Testing on Hyperledger Fabric v1.3 ======

On July 03, 2018, after the usual Unit Tests and merge jobs tests were executed in every repository in the hyperledger fabric project, a final set of Release Tests were triggered and executed on the released images. These included many from the fabric-samples repository: byfn, byfn upgrade, efyn with default channel, custom channel, couchdb, node chaincode on x86_64 and s390x platforms, and fabcar, balance-transfer, fabric-ca samples on x86_64 and mac. All worked as expected.
In addition, many people contributed by running through positive and negative test scenarios with variations of these scripts.
Finally, refer to the automated regression testing that was part of the the System Verification Testing (SVT) release verification. Here are the three sets of tests tracked on the v1.3 release dashboard:

  * [[https://jira.hyperledger.org/issues/?filter=12201|V1.3 Fabric SVT New Tests]] (project in (FAB, FABJ, FABN, "Fabric CA") AND issuetype = "Test Task" AND "Test Type" in ("System Test") AND fixVersion = v1.3.0 AND "Epic Link" in (FAB-10080, FAB-10081, FAB-10082, FAB-10083, FAB-10084, FAB-10085)).
  * [[https://jira.hyperledger.org/issues/?filter=12197|V1.3 Fabric SVT Regression]] test scripts from our library that were initiated manually during release testing (project in (FAB, FABJ, FABN, "Fabric CA") AND issuetype = "Test Task" AND "Test Type" = "System Test" AND fixVersion = v1.2.0 AND "Epic Link" in (FAB-10080, FAB-10081, FAB-10082, FAB-10083, FAB-10084, FAB-10085)).
  * [[https://jira.hyperledger.org/issues/?filter=12202|V1.3 Fabric SVT Regression Continuous Delivery]] test scripts executed automatically as part of the Continuous Integration daily test suites. (project = FAB AND component = fabric-quality AND issuetype in (Task, "Test Task") AND "Epic Link" is not EMPTY AND labels = SystemTestcase AND labels = ContinuousDelivery ORDER BY key DESC). Refer to the [[https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/tree/release-1.3/regression/daily|SVT Daily test folder]] for more information about all the daily tests executed.

|v1.3 Test Automation Overview]] offers a perspective from system test team on the state of automation testing during this release.
