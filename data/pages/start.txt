======  Welcome to the Hyperledger Wiki! ======

Hyperledger is a consortium of communities which works on two different levels.

  - Projects focus on implementations of blockchain frameworks, tools, and modules
  - Working groups focus on different aspects, typically independent of any specific implementation
